Description: # py-event-mocks
        
        Python implementation of [serverless / event-mocks](https://github.com/serverless/event-mocks)
        
        A small library that includes details mocks of AWS Lambda event sources, same with original event-mocks.
        Useful for use when unit testing your Lambda functions.
        Supported Event Sources are:
        - [x] API Gateway
        - [x] SNS
        - [x] SQS
        - [x] DynamoDB
        - [x] S3
        - [x] Scheduled
        - [x] Websocket
        - [x] Alexa Skill
        - [x] Alexa Smart Home
        - [x] CloudWatch
        - [x] CloudWatch Log
        - [x] Cognito Pool
        - [x] IoT
        - [x] AWS Batch
        
        The library simply uses default event source mock templates and merge it with any overwrite you provide. [Check out the JSON template files](src/py_event_mocks/events/aws) to learn more about the data structure of each event source.
        
        ## Set up
        
        ```bash
        pip install py-event-mocks
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python3
        from py_event_mocks import create_event
        
        event = create_event("aws:s3")
        
        # event would be
        #   {
        #     "Records": [
        #       {
        #         "eventVersion": "2.0",
        #         "eventSource": "aws:s3",
        #         "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
        #     ...
        #   }
        ```
        
        Allowed event_type (first parameter) is as follows:
        
        - "aws:alexa-skill-event"
        - "aws:alexa-smart-home-event"
        - "aws:api-gateway-event"
        - "aws:cloud-watch-event"
        - "aws:cloud-watch-log-event"
        - "aws:cognito-user-pool-event"
        - "aws:dynamo-stream-event"
        - "aws:kinesis"
        - "aws:s3"
        - "aws:scheduled"
        - "aws:sns"
        - "aws:sqs"
        
        You can overwrite default template with "body" parameter.
        
        ```python3
        event = create_event(
            event_type="aws:s3",
            body={
              "Records": [{
                "eventName": "ObjectCreated:Put",
                "s3": {
                  "bucket": {
                    "name": "my-bucket-name"
                  },
                  "object": {
                    "key": "object-key"
                  }
                }
              }]
            }
        )
        ```
