Changelog
=========

This is the changelog for Puppetboard.

Development
-----------

2.2.0
-----

* Fix default table sort (#444)
* Use a select for endpoint select in query (#575)
* Surround multiline messages with <pre> in reports (#576)
* Fix CI builds by requiring pytest >= 4.6 (#577)
* Add noop column in overview and nodes (#584)
* Add title to events labels in overview and nodes (#585)

2.1.2
----

* Puppet DB 5.2.13 requires v2 metrics

2.1.1
-----

* Added support for new metrics API `v2` on PuppetDB >= `5.3.11` and < `6.0.0` (#558)
* Added Python 3.5 back into test matrix (#559)
* Fixed bug in `dailyreport.js` that caused it not to render when served under a non-default virtual host (#557)

2.1.0
-----

* Fixed Puppetboard's usage for the new metrics v2 API both on the home page for computing the average resources/node and the `Metrics` listing page. This change now supports the changes in PuppetDB >= 6.9.1 (https://puppet.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-7943/)
* Added backwards compatability support for both the metric `v1` and `v2` endpoints
  depending on the version of the server. Any PuppetDB >= `6.9.1` will be queried with
  the `v2` endpoint automatically (because `v1` is disabled from here forward). Any
  PuppetDB <= `6.9.0` will use `v1`.
* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `>=2.1.0` because changes were needed in this library to support the metrics v2 fixes.
* app.py: Added python2 backwards compatability fix for importing `urllib`.

* Fixing corner-case where empty environments would trigger a ZeroDivisionError due to the Number of Nodes divided by the Number of Resources calculation
* Adding additional logging in utils.py

0.1.2
-----
* Add configuration option to set the default environment with new configuration option DEFAULT\_ENVIRONMENT, defaults to 'production'.
* Loading all available environments with every page load.
* Adding an "All Environments" item to the Environments dropdown to remove all environment filters on PuppetDB data.
* Updating README.rst to update links and describe new configuration options.

\* Updating the pypuppetdb requirement to \>= 0.2.1, using information  
available in PuppetDB 3.2 and higher

*\* latest\_report\_hash and latest\_report\_status fields from the Nodes endpoint, this effectively deprecates the report\_latest() function*\* code\_id from the Catalogs endpoint (current unused) \* Adding a automatic refresh on the overview page to reload the page every X number of seconds, defaults to 30. This is configurable with the configuration option REFRESH\_RATE \* Fixing the table alignment in the catalog\_compare() page by switching to fixed tables from basic tables. \* Using colors similar to Puppet Dashboard and Foreman for the status counts sections

0.1.1
-----

* Fix bug where the reports template was not generating the report links with the right environment

0.1.0
-----

* Requires pypuppetdb \>= 0.2.0
* Drop support for PuppetDB 2 and earlier
* Full support for PuppetDB 3.x
* The first directory location is now a Puppet environment which is filtered on all supported queries. Users can browse different environments with a select field in the top NavBar
* Using limit, order\_by and offset parameters adding pagaination on the Reports page (available in the NavBar). Functionality is available to pages that accept a page attribute.
* The report page now directly queries pypuppetdb to match the report\_id value with the report hash or configuration\_version fields.
* Catching and aborting with a 404 if the report and report\_latest function queries do not return a generator object.
* Adding a Catalogs page (similar to the Nodes page) with a form to compare one node's catalog information with that of another node.
* Updating the Query Endpoints for the Query page.
* Adding to `templates/_macros.html` status\_counts that shows node/report status information, like what is avaiable on the index and nodes pages, available to the reports pages and tables also.
* Showing report logs and metrics in the report page.
* Removing `limit_reports` from `utils.py` because this helper function has been replaced by the limit PuppetDB paging function.

**Known Issues**

* fact\_value pages rendered from JSON valued facts return no results. A more sophisticated API is required to make use of JSON valued facts (through the factsets, fact-paths and/or fact-contents endpoints for example)

0.0.5
-----

* Now requires WTForms versions less than 2.0
* Adding a Flask development server in `dev.py`.
* Adding CSRF protection VIA the flask\_wtf CsrfProtect object.
* Allowing users to configure the report limit on pages where reports are listed with the LIMIT\_REPORTS configuration option.
* Adding an inventory page to users to be able to see all available nodes and a configure lists of facts to display VIA the INVENTORY\_FACTS configuration option.
* Adding a page to view a node's catalog information if enabled, disabled by default. Can be changed with the ENABLE\_CATALOG configuration attribute.
* New configuration option GRAPH\_FACTS allows the user to choose which graphs will generate pie on the fact pages.
* Replacing Chart.js with c3.js and d3.js.
* Adding Semantic UI 0.16.1 and removing unused bootstrap styles.
* Adding an OFFLINE\_MODE configuration option to load local assets or from a CDN service. This is useful in environments without internet access.

0.0.4
-----

* Fix the sorting of the different tables containing facts.
* Fix the license in our `setup.py`. The license shouldn't be longer than 200 characters. We were including the full license tripping up tools like bdist\_rpm.

0.0.3
-----

This release introduces a few big changes. The most obvious one is the revamped
Overview page which has received significant love. Most of the work was done by
Julius HÃ¤rtl. The Nodes tab has been given a slight face-lift too.

Other changes:

* This release depends on the new pypuppetdb 0.1.0. Because of this the SSL configuration options have been changed:
  * `PUPPETDB_SSL` is gone and replaced by `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY` which now defaults to `True`. This only affects connections to PuppetDB that happen over SSL.
  * SSL is automatically enabled if both `PUPPETDB_CERT` and `PUPPETDB_KEY` are provided.
* Display of deeply nested metrics and query results have been fixed.
* Average resources per node metric is now displayed as a natural number.
* A link back to the node has been added to the reports.
* A few issues with reports have been fixed.
* A new setting called `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS` has been added which denotes the amount of hours after which Puppetboard will display the node as unreported if it hasn't checked in. We default to `2` hours.
* The event message can now be viewed by clicking on the event.

Puppetboard is now neatly packaged up and available on PyPi. This should
significantly help reduce the convoluted installation instructions people had
to follow.

Updated installation instructions have been added on how to install from PyPi
and how to configure your HTTPD.

0.0.2
-----

In this release we've introduced a few new things. First of all we now require pypuppetdb version 0.0.4 or later which includes support for the v3 API introduced with PuppetDB 1.5.

Because of changes in PuppetDB 1.5 and therefor in pypuppetdb users of the v2 API, regardless of the PuppetDB version, will no longer be able to view reports or events.

In light of this the following settings have been removed:

* `PUPPETDB_EXPERIMENTAL`

Two new settings have been added:

* `PUPPETDB_API`: an integer, defaulting to `3`, representing the API version we want to use.
* `ENABLE_QUERY`: a boolean, defaulting to `True`, on wether or not to be able to use the Query tab.

We've also added a few new features:

* Thanks to some work done during PuppetConf together with Nick Lewis (from Puppet Labs) we now expose all of PuppetDB's metrics in the Metrics tab. The formatting isn't exactly pretty but it's a start.
* Spencer Krum added the graphing capabilities to the Facts tab.
* Daniel Lawrence added a feature so that facts on the node view are clickable and take you to the complete overview of that fact for your infrastructure and made the nodes in the complete facts list clickable so you can jump to a node.
* Klavs Klavsen contributed some documentation on how to run Puppetboard with Passenger.

0.0.1
-----

Initial release.
