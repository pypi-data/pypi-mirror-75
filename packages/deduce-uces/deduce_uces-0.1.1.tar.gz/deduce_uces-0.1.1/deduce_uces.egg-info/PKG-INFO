Description: # dedUCE
        
        dedUCE is a tool for efficiently finding ultra-conserved elements across multiple genomes.
        
        ## Development tasks
        
        It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to prevent installed dependencies polluting your global Python installation.
        
        You can do this using:
        
        ```shell script
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
        
        ### Installing dependencies
        
        `make setup` for runtime dependencies
        
        `make setup-dev` for development tools
        
        ### Running dedUCE
        
        `make install` will install the CLI program `deduce`.
        
        Run `deduce -h` to see usage.
        
        ### Testing
        
        All tests live in the `/tests` directory. Run them using `make test`.
        
        ### Documentation
        
        Documentation is generated by Sphinx using `make docs`.
        
        ### Code standards
        
        Please adhere to the code standards set by the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) autoformatter. You can format all Python code with `make format`.
