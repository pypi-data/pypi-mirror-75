# prog_edu_assistant_tools 

Tools to create autogradeable assignments in Jupyter notebooks.
See the documentation in https://github.com/google/prog-edu-assistant
to get started with the autograder.

This package contains a few functions that makes authoring programming assignments in Jupyter
more convenient, including the following:

* A summarizing test runner to run unit tests
* A function that can run a unit test directly in the Jupyter notebook

The intention of this package is to hide all the smarts
of having a complete master notebook capable of complete auto-testing
behind nice and readable names that can be imported rather than reimplemented
in every master notebook.
