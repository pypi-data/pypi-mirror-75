Description: # Wagtail Footnotes
        
        This repo contains example code that can be copied and altered to add footnotes to your wagtail pages.
        
        ## Usage
         - Add the app to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
           ```python
           INSTALLED_APPS = [
               ...
               "wagtail_footnotes",
               ...
           ]
           ```
         - Add the footnotes `urls.py` to your project's `urls.py`:
           ```python
           from wagtail_footnotes import urls as footnotes_urls
           urlpatterns = [
               ...
               path("footnotes/", include(footnotes_urls)),
               ...
           ]
           ```
           Note: The URL NEEDS to be defined as above as it is currently hardcoded in the JS
         - Update your page models to show the footnotes field:
           ```python
           class InformationPage(BasePage):
                ...
                content_panels = [
                    ...
                    InlinePanel("footnotes", label="Footnotes"),
                ]
           ```
         - Update your `RichTextBlock`s 
            - Add `"footnotes"` to the `features` arg for each `RichTextBlock` that you want to have this functionality.
            - You will also need to change them from `RichTextBlock`s to `wagtail_footnotes.blocks.RichTextBlockWithFootnotes`
            - You can add the footnotes to `RichTextBlock`s across the project by updating `WAGTAILADMIN_RICH_TEXT_EDITORS["default"]["OPTIONS"]["features"]`:
              ```python
              WAGTAILADMIN_RICH_TEXT_EDITORS = {
                  "default": {
                      "WIDGET": "wagtail.admin.rich_text.DraftailRichTextArea",
                      "OPTIONS": {"features": ["bold", "italic", "h3", "h4", "ol", "ul", "link", "footnotes"]},
                  }
              }
              ```
         - Update your page templates to include `{% include "wagtail_footnotes/includes/footnotes.html" %}`
         - Make and run migrations:
           ```
           ./manage.py makemigrations
           ./manage.py migrate
           ```

            - Initial commit: https://git.torchbox.com/wharton/whartoninteractive/-/commit/d368d59d34743dd6164b54c83b86d2e1f3bb8e62
        
        ## Common issues
         - I click on the `Fn` button in the editor and it stops working
            - This is likely because the URL in the JS does not match the URL of the footnotes view. Check the URL in `wagtail_footnotes/static/footnotes/js/footnotes.js` matches the URL you set.
