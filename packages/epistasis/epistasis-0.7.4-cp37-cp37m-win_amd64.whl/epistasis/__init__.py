A Python API for modeling statistical, high-order epistasis in genotype-phenotype maps.
This library provides methods for:

    1. Decomposing genotype-phenotype maps into high-order epistatic interactions
    2. Finding nonlinear scales in the genotype-phenotype map
    3. Calculating the contributions of different epistatic orders
    4. Estimating the uncertainty of epistatic coefficients amd
    5. Interpreting the evolutionary importance of high-order interactions.

For more information about the epistasis models in this library, see our Genetics paper:

Currently, this package works only as an API and there is no command-line
interface. Instead, we encourage you use this package inside `Jupyter notebooks`_ .
