    The Sine matrix is defined as:

        Cij = 0.5 Zi**exponent      | i = j
            = (Zi*Zj)/phi(Ri, Rj)   | i != j

        vectors)

    The matrix is padded with invisible atoms, which means that the matrix is
    padded with zeros until the maximum allowed size defined by n_max_atoms is
    reached.
