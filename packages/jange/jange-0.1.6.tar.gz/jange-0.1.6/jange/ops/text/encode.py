    Parameters
    ----------
    max_features : Optional[int]
        If some value is provided then only top `max_features` words
        order by their count frequency are considered in the vocabulary

    max_df : Union[int, float]
        When building vocabulary, ignore terms that have document frequency higher
        than the given value. If the value is float, then it is considered as a ratio.

    min_df : Union[int, float]
        When building vocabulary, ignore terms that have document frequency less than
        the given valu. If the value is float, then it is considered as a ratio.

    ngram_range : Tuple[int, int]
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used. For example an ``ngram_range`` of ``(1, 1)`` means only
        unigrams, ``(1, 2)`` means unigrams and bigrams, and ``(2, 2)`` means
        only bigrams.

    norm : str
        Each output row will have unit norm, either:
        * 'l2': Sum of squares of vector elements is 1. The cosine
        similarity between two vectors is their dot product when l2 norm has
        been applied.
        * 'l1': Sum of absolute values of vector elements is 1.

    use_idf : bool
        Enable inverse-document-frequency reweighting.

    name : str
        name of this operation

    **kwargs
