# Signal Temporal Logic Monitoring

This package provides an interface to define offline monitoring for Signal Temporal
Logic (STL) specifications. The library is written in C++ (and can be used with [CMake])
and has been wrapped for Python usage using [pybind11].

The library is inspired by the following projects:

- [py-metric-temporal-logic] is a tool written in pure Python, and provides an elegant
  interface for evaluating discrete time signals using Metric Temporal Logic (MTL).
- [Breach] and [S-TaLiRo] are [Matlab] toolboxes designed for falsification and
  simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems with STL and MTL specifications,
  respectively. One of their various features includes the ability to evaluate the
  robustness of signals against STL/MTL.

The `signal-temporal-logic` library aims to be different from the above in the following
ways:

- Written for speed and targets Python.
    - While [py-metric-temporal-logic] is written in Python, it doesn't perform
      computations efficiently and quickly.
- Support for multiple quantitative semantics.
    - All the above tools have their own way of computing the quantitative semantics for
      STL/MTL specifications.
    - This tool will try to support common ways of computing the robustness, but will
      also have support for other quantitative semantics of STL.
