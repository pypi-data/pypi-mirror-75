# Roadmap for PySynphot

Some time in 2022, make a last release and archive this package.
Till then, no active development will happen, except maybe
critical bug fix, if deemed absolutely necessary.

Development will continue in:

* https://github.com/spacetelescope/synphot_refactor/
* https://github.com/spacetelescope/stsynphot_refactor/
