There's no need anymore to manually upload each file, replace each URL and copy paste your source code into a web form. Building and deployment can now be as simple as a ``git push``, thanks to `Travis <https://travis-ci.com>`_.

Please head over to the :ref:`overview` to read more about this project, or dive right in with the :ref:`usage-guide`. We've also created a step-by-step :ref:`tutorial` to get your wiki up and running quickly.
