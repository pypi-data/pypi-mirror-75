Description: # ChemistryTool (Python)
        
        Tested on both Python 3.6.7 and Python 3.7.4
        
        ChemistryTool is a library used for calculating common mathematical problems in chemistry, 
        getting basic information about elements and IUPAC Naming.
        
        ## Setup
        
        1. Create a virtual environment
