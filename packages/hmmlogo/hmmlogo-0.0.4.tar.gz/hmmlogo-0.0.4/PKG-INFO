        # Introduction
        
        [Pfam](https://pfam.xfam.org/) is a database that collects information about protein families
        and domains.  Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to
        classify the protein families and hold information about
        conservation and variability within family members.  Sequence logos
        are graphical representations of biological sequence alignments or
        HMMs, that give information about the conservation.
