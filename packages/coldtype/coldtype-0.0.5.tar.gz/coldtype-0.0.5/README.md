# Coldtype

_Hello and welcome to `coldtype`, an odd little library for programmatic typography, written by [Rob Stenson](https://robstenson.com), who is me, for use on Goodhertz projects and also other stuff._

## An example

```python
from coldtype import *

@renderable(rect=Rect(1080, 1080))
def render(r):
    style = Style("assets/MutatorSans.ttf", 250, wdth=0, wght=1, tu=-350, r=1, ro=1)
    return StyledString("COLDTYPE", style).pens().align(r).f("hr", 0.8, 0.7).understroke()
```

![Screenshot of app](https://coldtype.goodhertz.co/media/drawbotesque.png)

_A DrawBot-like programming experience, using VS Code and the Coldtype viewing app. (When you save the file in VS Code, the hanging process (as seen in the terminal) re-renders `simple.py` to SVG and sends the result via a websocket to the Coldtype viewing app, which displays the SVG with a standard Chromium-based webview.)_

## The Coldtype Viewer App

See `viewer/README.md` to build the Electron viewing app.

## More Examples

To try out Coldtype and see some examples (like the banner at the top of this README), check out the [coldtype-examples](https://github.com/goodhertz/coldtype-examples) repository, where there are instructions on how to download and setup Coldtype in a python3.8 environment.

___

## Installation

### In a virtual environment

If you‚Äôre using a version of Python >= 3.7, you should be able to add `coldtype` to your virtual environment with this command:

- `pip install "coldtype[renderer]"`
- `pip install git+https://github.com/typemytype/drawbot`

The `drawbot` step is optional, and Mac-specific, but you‚Äôll probably want it if you‚Äôre using a Mac, since Cairo (the alternate rasterizer) is quite hard to install. The `[renderer]` bit is not optional if you intend on using the `coldtype` command-line tool (as discussed below), but it is optional if you‚Äôre using Coldtype just for its typesetting (i.e. if you‚Äôre using it with Blender or another environment that provides code-reloading and rendering).

To test that you have a working installation, try this command with your virtual env activated:

> `coldtype -h`

You‚Äôll also need the Coldtype app, which is a cross-platform app that displays SVG previews of coldtype programs, via websockets.

- Mac app: https://install.goodhertz.co/coldtype/alpha-0.0.1/coldtype-0.0.1.dmg
- Windows app: https://install.goodhertz.co/coldtype/alpha-0.0.1/coldtype.exe

Though it‚Äôs not strictly necessary to have this app open at all times, it‚Äôs just something I leave open on my computer, so whenever I want to see the visual output of a coldtype program, it‚Äôs ready to go.

**N.B.** _This app isn‚Äôt signed or anything, we should work on that._

## What is Coldtype?

__A cross-platform library to help you precisely & programmatically do high-quality display typography with Python.__

Yes, there are lots of ways to set type with code. Most ways ‚Äî¬†HTML/CSS/JS, Processing, etc. ‚Äî are great for 90% of what most people want to do with Latin-based writing systems. Then the road runs out and you can‚Äôt do anything else.

Coldtype is an offroad vehicle that lets you keep driving where there are no roads. Like many vehicles built for specialized use, it is not user-friendly. It has no doors (please climb in through the window), and the steering wheel is not very intuitive, also it‚Äôs a stick-shift, and you should probably know how to code (or be willing to learn) if you‚Äôre going to drive it alone out into the desert. (I apologize for how automotive this metaphor is getting. Probably should‚Äôve gone with some metaphor about people making custom synthesizers in the 70s.)

### What about DrawBot?

If you‚Äôve heard of [DrawBot](http://www.drawbot.com/) ‚Äî another offroad vehicle that lets you drive where you want ‚Äî¬†you may be wondering how Coldtype is different. The answer is that Coldtype provides a very different programming idiom, one based around creating and modifying structured data that can be rendered, rather than ‚Äî¬†as is common in most ‚Äúcreative coding‚Äù platforms (including DrawBot) ‚Äî¬†providing a metaphorical canvas that you render to directly.

Also Coldtype works on Windows (and Linux, theoretically).

(I should point out that I love DrawBot and that Coldtype would not exist without DrawBot, mostly because using DrawBot was my first time driving in the typographical offroad. That said, Coldtype mostly exists as a response to things I found awkward when programming animations with DrawBot.)

### What about Adobe products?

I‚Äôve learned over the last few years to distrust any _Type Tool_ in an Adobe product (or anywhere else). Yes, those can be very good ‚Äî¬†like HTML+CSS ‚Äî¬†for doing simple Latin-based typography for static designs. But then, all of a sudden, they are very bad. You can think of Adobe products as a train that you get on and you can fall asleep in a nice seat and the train will get you where you want to go, except when you wake up and realize you wanted to go somewhere the train doesn't go and then you‚Äôre like... _dang, do I have to walk?_ (Walking in this metaphor is when you right click and hit _Convert to Outlines_.)

Walking can be a lot of fun, and you get to see a lot. But sometimes you want to get there faster or you want to go farther. Yes, I realize now this metaphor has made me seem very pro-automobile, which... yes I do live in Los Angeles but I work from home, so I‚Äôm kind of ambivalent about cars.

But I‚Äôm not ambivalent about typesetting with code, so let‚Äôs get into it!

## What does a Coldtype program look like?

First, make sure to have the Coldtype desktop app open on your computer, and also have a virtual environment activated on the command line, with coldtype installed (as described above).

Now, some example code:

```python
from coldtype import *

@renderable(rect=(1350, 500))
async def render(r):
    return StyledString("COLDTYPE", Style("assets/MutatorSans.ttf", 300, wght=1, tu=-250, r=1)).pens().align(r, tv=1).f("random").understroke()
```

You can run this with the `coldtype` command-line tool, e.g.:

`coldtype examples/example.py -w`

The `-w` flag means the process will hang and monitor the file for changes. So if you edit the file and hit save, the changes (or errors) will show up in thd Coldtype app automatically.

### Some thoughts about that code

You may look at that code and think to yourself: _wtf_. Yes, that is an appropriate reaction. Conventional wisdom in the programming world is that, when balancing the readability and writeability of code, the scales should be tipped towards _readable_. Here the scales are tipped the other way, because coldtype is meant as a **design idiom** for Python. The output of a coldtype program is not a piece of software that you‚Äôll have to maintain for years to come; the output is a video, or an image, or something like that ‚Äî¬†an artifact. You may want to read a coldtype program again one day, but only for the purpose of learning or plagiarizing your past self.

## How does Coldtype work?

Coldtype is, more than anything else, a programmatic frontend to high-quality typesetting code, provided ‚Äî¬†in this latest iteration of Coldtype ‚Äî¬†by the excellent FontGoggles repository. (This was not always the case, but FontGoggles provides a much better version of some Harfbuzz+Freetype code that )

Coldtype also provides a set of idioms for holding and manipulating typographic data.

The central graphic element of Coldtype (the `DATPen`) is a wrapper around `fontTool`‚Äôs `RecordingPen`, and the central typesetting element (`StyledString`) provides access to a rich set of styling options.

For rasterization/output, Coldtype can be used with Cairo cross-platform, or DrawBot on macOS.

## Why is an audio software company releasing a typography library?

Because (__A__) I love fonts and (__B__) audio software interfaces use fonts (and have some unique design constraints for typography), also (__C__) we make lots of ads that feature typography that reacts to audio and midi data. The code that powers the audio/midi data does not live in this library, but those reactions are made possible by the typography features of Coldtype.

## Why ‚Äúcoldtype‚Äù?

Coldtype refers to the short-lived era of early digital typesetting (extending roughly from the late 1940s to the widespread adoption of personal computing in the early 1990s), during which time computers were used to control various analog photographic processes for setting type, technologies now known, usually, as ‚Äúphototype,‚Äù but sometimes also known as ‚Äúcoldtype,‚Äù to distinguish it from hot-metal type, which was the previous standard. (And it was hot ‚Äî¬†Linotype machines were known to squirt molten lead out at the operator.)

Phototype/coldtype was a hybrid moment in typographic history, and a fascinating one ‚Äî 500 years of metal-type-based assumptions were upended all at once, as letters now did not need to live on a rectangular metal body, meaning they could get really close together. (Which, for me, really helps explain, like, all of graphic design between 1960 and 1980.)

Also originally I thought it was a funny name because I wanted to make a very fast typesetting library using Harfbuzz, and when computers run quickly and efficiently, they remain cold. Of course, I now regularly use all 8 cores of my computer when I use render 1000s of frames at once using coldtype, which gets the fans going, so really it's more like warmtype.

## Weirdnesses

- __0-1 variation axes value__ ‚Äî¬†By default, all font variation values (axis values) are scaled to a 0-1 range. I‚Äôve found I almost never want to set a font variation value in the scale set by the font itself, mostly because I‚Äôm almost always mapping a 0-1 time (or amplitude) value to the axis. If you‚Äôd like to not "(s)cale (v)arations," set `sv=False` when constructing a `Style` object.

- __Extensive use of acronyms__ ‚Äî¬†Because designing-in-code can be typing-intensive, there are a ton of acronym-based methods and dict keys, i.e. `.f("hr",0.5,0.5)` for setting the fill color on a `DATPen` to a random hue with 0.5 saturation and 0.5 lightness.

## Programming philosophy

Here is a free-associated list of things that I think define the general vibe of programming in Coldtype (a work-in-progress)

- Chained mutation/transformation
    - "Chaining" in this context refers to the programming style favored by libraries like jQuery, which allows you to call multiple methods on a single line, all of which mutate the state of an object and return the object itself in each mutating call. For example:
        - `DATPen().rect(Rect(500, 500)).translate(100, 100).rotate(45)` creates a `DATPen` object, then adds a rectangle bezier to it, then translates it, then rotates it, all in a single line. In normal circumstances, programming like this is called "spaghetti" code because it's long and hard to follow, or something like that. In this case, its brevity is its benefit
        - Yes I know mutation is theoretically ‚Äúbad‚Äù or whatever, yeesh, I just really love how it works in real life.
- Coldtype does not use classic "drawing"-style APIs/graphic state, though the data model of Coldtype can be (and is meant to be) serialized to any number of canvas/drawing APIs, and can be extended to any API that implements `fill`/`stroke` and `moveTo`/`lineTo`/`curveTo`

# Caveats

## What is Coldtype _not_?

- Coldtype is not good for setting large amounts of text in a single frame, because Coldtype has no line-breaking algorithms.
- This means Coldtype is probably bad for most print applications (you should use DrawBot for that, because DrawBot has line-breaking algorithms).
- In fact, Coldtype is not good at most things that normal type-setting software is good at. Generally-speaking, the goal of this library is to give you exactly what you want, rather than a ‚Äúbest guess.‚Äù For example:
    - Coldtype does not implement fallback support (expect to see some `.notdef`s)

## How is this different from DrawBot?

- Use whatever text editor you want
- Cross-platform
- Does not rely on Apple‚Äôs CoreText engine or the mostly deprecated APIs that DrawBot uses to interact with it
- Really only a small subset of what DrawBot, by leveraging CoreText and CoreImage, can do (which is a good thing to me, because I only ever used DrawBot for typography anyway)
- Little-to-no image support (some, but it is vvv primitive)

---

## Working on Coldtype

- `cd` into the `coldtype` directory
- `python3.8 -m venv venv --prompt=coldtype`
- `source env/bin/activate`

Now you should see `(coldtype)` prepended to your terminal prompt. If that‚Äôs the case, continue with this invocation:

- `pip install -e .`
- Open the Coldtype app (just a normal desktop app, you can open it by double-clicking)

- `coldtype example/example.py -w`
- `ctrl+c` to exit

# Other Stuff, Optional

### DrawBot (optional but very useful for image-rendering)

- `pip install git+https://github.com/typemytype/drawbot`

### Cairo (don‚Äôt do this is you don‚Äôt have to, which, if you‚Äôre on a mac, you don‚Äôt have to)

- `brew install cairo pkg-config`
- `pip install pycairo`

Then if that doesn‚Äôt work, add to your `~/.bash_profile` ([via](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues/524)):

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib"
```

Then with a re-loaded bash you can `pip install pycairo` again ‚Äî hopefully it works!
