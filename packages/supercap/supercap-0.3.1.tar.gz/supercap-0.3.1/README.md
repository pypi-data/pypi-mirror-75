# SuperCap-Python!

A Supercapacitor modelling library for Python

## Overview
SuperCap-Python, a toolset for super capacitor modelling and simulation consisting of Python packages. It can be used to performing high-fidelity simulations of charge, discharge and self-discharge processes of super capacitors.


##  Getting it

To download SuperCap-Python, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install supercap
```
## Usage

Sample usage example can be found in examples folder.

## Roadmap and future work

* Implement more equivalent circuit models available in literature
* Implement models that also consider Electrochemical properties of super capacitor
* Integration of Photovoltaic models and optimization aspects
