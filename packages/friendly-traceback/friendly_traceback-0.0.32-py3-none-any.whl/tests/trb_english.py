Friendly tracebacks - in English
======================================

Friendly-traceback aims to provide friendlier feedback when an exception
is raised than what is done by Python.
Below, we can find some examples. SyntaxError cases are
shown in a separate page.
Ideally, an example of each case handled by friendly-traceback
should be included here.

.. note::

     The content of this page is generated by running
     {name} located in the ``tests/`` directory.
     This needs to be done explicitly, independently of updating the
     documentation using Sphinx.
     On Windows, if Sphinx is installed on your computer, it is suggested
     instead to run make_trb.bat in the root directory as it will create
     similar files for all languages *and* update the documentation.
