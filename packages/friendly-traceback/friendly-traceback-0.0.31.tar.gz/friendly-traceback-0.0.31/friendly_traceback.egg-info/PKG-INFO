Description: # friendly-traceback
        Aimed at Python beginners: replacing standard traceback by something easier to understand, translatable into various languages.
        
        [See the documentation here](https://aroberge.github.io/friendly-traceback-docs/docs/html/)

        ## State of this project
        
        Friendly-traceback is alpha. The current focus is on quickly increasing
        the number of exceptions covered.  We strive to test the code as new additions
        are made: everything included should work.  However, the code itself
        could probably be refactored and could definitely be better documented.
        
        ## Code of Conduct
        
        We completely support the
        [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
        Contributors to this project, including those filing or commenting on an issue,
        are expected to do the same.
