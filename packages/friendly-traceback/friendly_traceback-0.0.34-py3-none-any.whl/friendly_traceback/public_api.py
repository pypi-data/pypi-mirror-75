With the exception of 1) this package version and 2) some Friendly-console
related classes or functions, this module includes **all** the functions
that are part of the public API and can be directly used, as in::

    import friendly_traceback
    friendly_traceback.some_function()

instead of::

    import friendly_traceback
    friendly_traceback.public_api.some_function()


Note that this excludes a few modules that are used to install
friendly-traceback upon importing it, such as::

    from friendly_traceback import explanations
    from friendly_traceback import explications  # French version
