## State of this project

Friendly-traceback is alpha. The current focus is on quickly increasing
the number of exceptions covered.  We strive to test the code as new additions
are made: everything included should work.  However, the code itself
could probably be refactored and could definitely be better documented.

## Code of Conduct

We completely support the
[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
Contributors to this project, including those filing or commenting on an issue,
are expected to do the same.
