# acousondePy
 Translate Acousonde MT files

 This software lets you load any Acousonde produced MT files and convert them into easier to use formats.
- Acoustic data files are converted into wav files
- Header information is stored as csv file
- Auxiliary data if present is concatenated into one csv file

For more information on Acousonde visit the [Acousonde website](http://www.acousonde.com/)

Currently there are 4 functions available:

- MTread() to read one MT file
- spec_plot(p,HEADER,INFO) to create a spectrogram plot
- read_multiple_MT() to read a list of MT files
- acousonde() starts a GUI which allows you to convert slected MT files

Acousonde is available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/acousondePy/)

A single Windows executable file of acousonde() which can be used without the need of any programming/scripting and does not require the user to have Python isnstalled can be obtained from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acousonde2wav/).

# Installation

# Examples

For a full example have a look at the Notebooks in the notebook folder.

```python
import acousondePy as ap
import glob

#get example file dir
pdir = ap.__path__[0]

#get list of example files
fns = glob.glob(pdir + '\\\data\*.MT')

#read an acoustic MT file
p, HEADER, INFO = ap.MTread(fns[4])

#create a spectrogram plot
_=ap.spec_plot(p, HEADER, INFO)

#read multiple MT files
ap.read_multiple_MT(fns)
```
