sqlalchemy models for strategy tables

@author: Mike Petersen
@creation_date: 5/5/2020

@ Programming Notes:
The strategy table has no relationship with TradeSums.strategy column which is a string so that
one-off # strategies can be named by the user without adding them to the database
### The strangeness ...
of having the seperate table for description, which is one to one, was a plan to allow user
created 'strategy packages' that could be exchanged.  That was a while ago and I don't know
if I will implement the strategy packages. My thinking now is that if I do implement it, there
is a better abstraction (at a higher level with a 'strategy_packages' table) and description
should probably be a column in strategy-- that means migration. (But after sa transition is
complete)
