            }
        
        ## Installation
        PyIT2FLS can be installed by unzipping the source code in one directory and using this command:
        
            (sudo) python3 setup.py install
        
        Or you can use pip3:
        
            (sudo) pip3 install --upgrade pyit2fls
        
        ## Examples
        There are ten examples provided over github page along with the toolkit, which are listed as below:
        
        * Ex1: Defining an Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Set (IT2FS)
        
        * Ex2: Application of join and meet operators and plotting the outputs
        
        * Ex3: Defining a simple (MIMO) IT2FLS
        
        * Ex4: Prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series with PSO-based parameter tuning
        
        * Ex5: Designing Interval Type 2 Fuzzy PID (IT2FPID) controller for a time-delay linear system
        
        * Ex6: Creating and plotting ten types of interval type two fuzzy sets.
        
        * Ex7: Similar to Ex3 but implemented using the new Mamdani class. The new Mamadani class is 3 times faster compared to the IT2FLS class.
        
        * Ex8: Defining a simple multi-input multi-output IT2 TSK FLS.
        
        * Ex9: Defining a multi-input multi-output IT2 TSK FLS and plotting the 3D resulting output planes.
        
        * Ex10: Defining a multi-input multi-output IT2FLS with different domains for each of input and output variables, and plotting the output surfaces of the system.
