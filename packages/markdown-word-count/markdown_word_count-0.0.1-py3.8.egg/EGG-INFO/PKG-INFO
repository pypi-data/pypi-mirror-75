        A word counter for raw Markdown files, excluding punctuation, footnotes, and special Markdown or HTML tag syntax.
        
        ## 💻 Installation
        
        You will need...
        
        - 🐍 Python 3
        - 🐑 A [clone](https://github.com/gandreadis/markdown-word-count.git) of this repo or a [single file download](https://github.com/gandreadis/markdown-word-count/blob/master/mwc.py) of the script.
        
        ## ▶ Usage
        
        To run this script, pass the file you want to have analyzed as the first parameter:
        
        ```
        ./mwc.py myfile.md
        ```
        
        If that doesn't work, explicitely pass the program to Python:
        
        ```
        python mwc.py myfile.md
        ```
        
        If this doesn't work, try `python3` instead of `python`.
        
        ## ⛏ Development
        
        Run this to execute all tests:
        
        ```
        python -m unittest discover
        ```
