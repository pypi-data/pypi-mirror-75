Description: # skyhookfilecrypt
        File encryption and decryption module extracted from Skyhook: https://github.com/deedeecx330/skyhook
        
        # Usage
        The module has two functions, encryptFile and decryptFile. The function arguments in both cases are: 
        -   File that is to be encrypted/decrypted
        -   Output file where encrypted/decrypted contents will be saved to
        -   A passphrase to encrypt/decrypt the file with
        
        For example
        ```
        skyhookfilecrypt.encryptFile(file.in, file.out, password)
        ```
        will encrypt file.in with the given password and write the encrypted contents of file.in to file.out. Same principle works for decrypting files.
