# XICRA: Small RNAseq pipeline for paired-end reads

## Description

XICRA is a python pipeline developed in multiple separated modules that it is designed to take 
paired end fastq reads, trim adapters and low-quality base pairs positions, and merge reads (R1 & R2) 
that overlap. Using joined reads it describes all major RNA biotypes present in the samples including 
miRNA and isomiRs, tRNA fragments (tRFs) and piwi associated RNAs (piRNAs).

So far, XICRA produces a miRNA analysis at the isomiR level using joined reads, multiple software at the 
user selection and following a standardization procedure. Results are generated for each sample analyzed and 
summarized for all samples in a single expression matrix. This information can be processed at the miRNA or 
isomiR level (single sequence) but also summarizing for each isomiR variant type. This information can be 
easily accessed using the accompanied R package XICRA.stats. Although the pipeline is designed to take 
paired-end reads, it also accepts single-end reads.

## Installation

XICRA is available in the Python Package Index ([pip](https://pypi.org/)).

To install type: 

`pip install XICRA`
