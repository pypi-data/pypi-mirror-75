Description: # IOManage
         Manages IO operations of a single file
        
        ## Applications in which this library is useful
        
        The only scenario I made this library for is when reading and
        writing from a single file in more than a single thread.
        
        Currently also working on classes to read and write from/to massive JSON files
        
        ## Features
        
        ```diff
        ! IOManager Class
        + Read/Write queue system
        + Can cleanly close file, finishing all r/w functions before terminating
        + ID system for holding queue for write after a read to prevent data mismatching
        + Loop runs in its own thread, so no asyncio management is required
        
        ! IOJson, IOList and IODict Classes
        + Can index massive lists and dicts from JSON files
        + Dictionaries read from JSON are IODict objects
        + Lists read from JSON are IOList objects
        + Each IOList, IODict, and IOJson class has only 1 key and/or value stored in memory at one time
        - Can not detect malformed JSON, instead will (probably) break
        - Can not (yet) iterate through IODict, and IOJson classes
        - NOT THREADSAFE!
        ```
