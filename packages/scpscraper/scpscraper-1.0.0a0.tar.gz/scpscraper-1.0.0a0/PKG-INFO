        # SCP Scraper
        A small Python library designed for scraping data from the SCP wiki. Made with AI training (namely NLP models) and dataset collection (for things like categorization of SCPs for external projects) in mind, and has arguments to allow for ease of use in those applications.
        
        Below you will find installation instructions, examples of how to use this library, and the ways in which you can utilize it. I hope you find this as useful as I have!
        
        ## Installation
        `scpscraper` can be installed via `pip install`. Here's the command I recommend using, so you consistently have the latest version.
        ```
        pip3 install --upgrade scpscraper
        ```
        
        ## Sample Code
        #### The Basics
        ##### Importing the Library
        ```py
        # Before we begin, we obviously have to import scpscraper.
        import scpscraper
        ```
        
        ##### Grabbing an SCP's Name
        ```py
        # Let's use 3001 (Red Reality) as an example.
        name = scpscraper.get_scp_name(3001)
        
        print(name) # Outputs "Red Reality"
        ```
        
        ##### Grabbing as many details as possible about an SCP
        
        ```py
        # Again using 3001 as an example
        info = scpscraper.get_scp(3001)
        
        print(info) # Outputs a dictionary with the
        # name, object id, rating, page content by section, etc.
        ```
        
        ## Planned Updates
        Potential updates in the future to make scraping data from any website easy/viable, allowing for easy mass collection of data.
