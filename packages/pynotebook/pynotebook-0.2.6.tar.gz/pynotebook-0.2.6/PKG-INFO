        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Pynotebook is a library for creating notebook applications in
        wxpython. A notebook is a document which can contain program code,
        text and graphics.  Notebooks are a pleasant way to develop and
        document code and to store ideas.
        
        Unlike other python notebook interfaces such as jupyter or spyder, pnb
        is very lightweight and can be easily embeded in wxpython
        applications.
        
        Although python is the native language for pynotebook, it is
        possible create notebooks for other scripting languages.
        
        Applications using the Pynotebook library are
        
        - `pnb application <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pnb>`_ (a python notebook application) and
        - `rnb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rnb>`_ (an experimental notebook for the r programming language)
