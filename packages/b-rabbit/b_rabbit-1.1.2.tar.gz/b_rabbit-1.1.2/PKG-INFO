        RabbitMQ without headache.
        ---------------------------
        
        b_rabbit is a RabbitMq Interface on top of rabbitpy to make implementing RabbitMQ messaging patterns easier. It is very useful especially
        inside large projects, in which many boilerplate code must be written.
        it uses a parent wrapper class that wrap all connections and classes definitions of different messaging patterns,
        then using the patterns is pretty straightforward by creating instances from the parent class depending on the
        pattern you want to use. it uses multithreading to asynchronously orchestrate between multiple subscription and RPCs.

        Features
        --------
        
        - it implements all RabbitMQ messaging patterns.
        - provides an easy high level API (take a look at the examples)
        - thread safe since it uses rabbitpy
        - implementation of the publish-subscribe pattern
        - implementation of the Remote procedure call pattern
        - safe message delivery
        
        When you should use it
        ----------------------
        - if you are having problems with other non thread safe libraries (like I did)
        - if you want to develop fast by using a high level API
        - if you don't want to write much code and save much time
        - if you want to use multithreading
        - if you want to get started with RabbitMQ
        
        Why you should use it
        ----------------------
        - High level of abstraction
        - Simple syntax and readability improvement
        - Scalablity (since it uses multiple channels but only one connection)
        - Asynchronous fast messaging
        - Code reusability
        
        Quick Usage
        ------------
        
        import the library:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
        
            from b_rabbit import BRabbit
        
        create a parent instance which provide a global rabbitMQ connection
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            rabbit = BRabbit(host='localhost', port=5672)
        
        now, just one liner to publish a message:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            publisher = rabbit.EventPublisher(b_rabbit=rabbit,
                                              publisher_name='pub').publish(routing_key='testing.test',
                                                                            payload='Hello from publisher')
        
        
        
        or if you want to subscribe and listen to a certain topic:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
             def callback(msg):
                # do something with the received msg from the publisher
                print(f"msg received: {msg}")
        
            # subscribe and run a listener in a thread
        
            subscriber = rabbit.EventSubscriber(
                                            b_rabbit=rabbit,
                                            routing_key='testing.test',
                                            publisher_name='pub',
                                            event_listener=callback).subscribe_on_thread()
        
        Further
        --------
        
        Take a look in the examples folder for more. b_rabbit implements also the remote procedure call (RPC) pattern
