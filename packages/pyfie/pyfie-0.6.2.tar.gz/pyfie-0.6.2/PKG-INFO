Description: Thank you for choosing pyfie!
        
        -----------------------------------------
        
        Here are the (shared) things you can use:
        
        **tile(value, password = None)**
        
        `tile()` is a shared class, that's used to make instances that can be encrypted into files.
        
        **write(path: str, value: tile)**
        
        `write()` is a shared function, that tries to write an encrypted tile class instance into the file in path.
        
        **read(path: str, password = None)**
        
        `read()` is a shared function, which is used to (try to) return a decrypted tile class instance from the file in path.
