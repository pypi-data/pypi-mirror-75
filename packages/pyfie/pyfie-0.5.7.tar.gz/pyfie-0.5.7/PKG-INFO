Description: Thank you for choosing pyfie!
        
        ------------------------------------------
        
        Here are the (shared) methods you can use:
        
        **compose(path: str, value, password = None)**
        
        `compose()` is a function used to create files with an encrypted value. Sets the password for this (hopefully) unique path as given.
        
        **parse(path: str, password = None)**
        
        `parse()` is a function used to get decrypted value of a file, but first, given password must match with the set one.

        In update *this* I have completely rewrote the way, that pyfie encrypts and decrypts files. That's why the structure of functions changed.
        
        Now, it uses pickle module and classes, with a simple idea of passwords. 
        
        -------------
        
        Last changes:
        
        * 0.4.8 - made the `password` argument default (as *None*)
        * 0.5.1 - now pyfie is even more secure
        * 0.5.2 - sorted things into specific files
        * 0.5.6 - new files tree
