Description: ## bgg-cohomology
        
        This is an implementation of a computer algorithm to compute the BGG resolution and its cohomology of a Verma module. 
        
        You can find the documentation for this package right here:
        https://bgg-cohomology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
        
        ## Installation
        
        After installing `sage` run the following command:
        
        ```
            sage -pip install git+https://github.com/RikVoorhaar/bgg-cohomology.git
        ```
        
        In MacOS and linux this should run just fine. When using Windows,
        make sure to run this command from the Sagemath Shell.
        
        To open the `.ipynb` files in the `computations` and `examples` folders, you need to
        first of all clone this repository. Then you can either launch `Sagemath Notebook` (on Windows) or run the following in the command line:
        
        ```
            sage -n
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        There is a basic tutorial of how to use this module in the `examples` directory. 
        Furthermore the `computations` directory contains notebooks with the code we used
        for the results in our preprint. 
        
        ## Credit
        All the code has been written by **Rik Voorhaar**. 
         Additional credit goes to **Nicolas Hemelsoet** for many aspects of the algorithm implemented here.
         This work has been partially financially supported by **NCCR SwissMAP**.
