"""
Compute signs for the BGG complex.

For every edge in the Bruhat graph, we need to find a sign such that
the product of signs in every square is -1. Mutliplying the maps
in the BGG complex by these signs ensures that the differential
squares to zero.

The algorithm used to compute this is a randomized greedy algorithms.
We start with a random configuration of signs. Then we flip the sign
of an edge if it reduces the number of squares where the product
of signs is -1. We keep up with this procedure until there is nothing left,
in which case we are either done, or we got stuck and we flip
the signs of some random edges.
