Synapse models
==============

In this section, the questions that how ``synapses`` model is designed and how to 
customize a synapse model will be answered.

The design of the ``synapses`` object
-------------------------------------

A ``synapses`` object in NumpyBrain represents the connectivity between two
neuron groups. Similar to ``neurons`` object, it has four important attributes
and three essential function.

state
*****

In a *synapses* model, ``state`` (see Figure 1) constains three two-dimensional 
matrix, which wraps all variables defined in a synapses object, including the 
dynamical variables, the static variables and others.

    Figure 1. The state in a synapses model. 

1. The first state matrix with the shape of :math:`(L1, num\_pre)` represents 
   the state variables with the length of :math:`num\_pre` (see Figure 1, 
   `Pre-shape state`), for example, the pre-synaptic spikes, or the pre-synaptic 
   membrane potentials. The last array is fixed to receive the pre-synaptic 
   spikes (the box with the solid lines). Other rows are free for users to 
   define other variables.
2. The second state matrix with the shape of :math:`(L2, num\_post)` denotes the 
   collection of the state variables with the length of :math:`num\_post` (see 
   Figure 1, `Post-shape state`), for example, the delayed conductance which 
   going to deliver to the post-synaptic neurons, or the post-synaptic membrane 
   potentials. In NumpyBrain, the first :math:`delay\_length` arrays are used to
   constain the delayed conductance. 
3. The third state matrix with the shape of :math:`(L3, num\_syn)` is the state 
   represents synapse-shaped variables. Each array has the length of 
   :math:`num\_syn`. This matrix is created according to the user demands.

Here, we sould pay attention on the conductance delays. In order to get the 
efficient deley computation, we fix the delay matrix (with a dimension of 
:math:`(delay\_lendth, num\_post)`), and rotate it at each updating time-step
(see Figure 2). In Figure 2, we denote the array position of output conductance 
as `out`, and the array reveiving the input conductance as `in`. As illustrated, 
at :math:`t=0`, the conductance `out` delivering to the post-synaptic neurons is 
at the first row, while the newly computated conductance `in` will be append to 
the last row. At :math:`t=1`, `out` and `in` go one step, and become `1` and `0`,
respectively. Such rotation lasts with the each time-step.

var2index
*********

Similar to the `var2index` in a `neurons` model, ``var2index`` in the `synapses` 
model is also an interface for `monitor` recording. Take 
`short-term synaptic plasticity <https://github.com/oujago/NumpyBrain/blob/master/npbrain/synapses/short_term_plasticity.py>`_ 
model for example,

.. code-block:: python

    var2index = {'u': (2, 0), 'x': (2, 1)}

represents the variable :math:`x` and the utilization parameter :math:`u` is stored
at first and second row in the third matrix `state[2]`, respectively.

delay
*****

``delay`` should be declared. If can be None, or a digital number. 

num
***

``num`` should also be explicitly declared in the `synapses` model. `num` is the
total number of synapse between two connected neuron groups. 


update_state()
**************

``update_state()`` is a must defined function to update `synapses` model's state.
It is written according to synapse dynamics.


output_synapse()
****************

``output_synapse()`` function must be defined to output the computed synaptic values.  
It is an interface between `synapses` and the `post-synaptic neurons`. 

The default `output_synapse()` function is to add the delayed `conductance` (here 
is the current) to the `state` position of `post-synaptic neurons` which receives 
the synaptic inputs, i.e.,

.. code-block:: python

    neu_state[-1] += syn_state[output_idx[0]][output_idx[1]]

where `neu_state[-1]` is the neuron array receiving the synaptic input, 
and `output_idx` is the position of output conductance in the synapse state. 


collect_spike()
***************

``collect_spike()`` function must be defined to collect spikes from the pre-synaptic 
and post-synaptic neurons. It is also an interface, which guarantee the `synapses` 
model is an independent component. 

The default `collect_spike()` function is to collect the spiking state of 
pre-synaptic neurons to the `pre-shaped state`, i.e.,

.. code-block:: python

    syn_state[0][-1] = pre_neu_state[-3]

where `syn_state[0][-1]` is the fixed synapse array to receive pre-synaptic spikes,
and `pre_neu_state[-3]` is the spiking state array of pre-synaptic neuron.

Synapse connectivity
********************

Before going to the difinition of new synapse model, we should figure out 
what is the most efficient synapse structure to calculate synapse state. 
In practice, the number of synapse is far bigger than the neurons. Usually, 
the time spending on the synapse computation is 10 times of neuron computation's. 
So, the bottleneck of simulation speed lies on the computation of synapses. 
We compared many ways of synapse structure implementation (please check
:doc:`fast synapse computation <fast_synapse_computation>`), and finally, we 
propose an indexing data structure (see Figure 3) to efficiently compute 
synapse states.

    Figure 3. The connnectivity structure in a synapses model.

To implement the synapse connectivity, three arrays should be defined (see Figure 3): 
``pre_ids`` (array with the green color), ``post_ids`` (array with the peak color),
and ``anchors`` (array with the yellow color). 

- `pre_ids` is a one-dimensional array which showes the connected pre-synaptic 
  neuron indices. 
- `post_ids` is a one-dimensional array which contains the connected post-synaptic 
  neuron indices. Combining `pre_ids` with `post_ids`, we get the connected neuron 
  pairs :math:`(pre\_ids(i), post\_ids(i))`.
- `anchors` is a two-dimensional array which contains the start and end position 
  of `post_ids` for a pre-synaptic neuron index. For example, to get the neurons 
  connected with pre-synaptic neuron :math:`i`, we can use: 

.. math::

    start, end = anchors[i] 

    post\_neurons = post\_ids[start: end]


AMPA conductance-based synapse
******************************

Here, we use AMPA conductance-based synapse model to show how to define a 
`synapses` model.

First of all, import the package

.. code-block:: python
    
    import nprain as nn


Mathematically, AMPA synapse is given by:

.. math::

    I_{syn}&=\bar{g}_{syn} s (V-E_{syn}) \quad (1)
    
    \frac{d s}{d t}&=-\frac{s}{\tau_{decay}}+\sum_{k} \delta(t-t_{j}^{k}) \quad (2)


In this model, only one `SYN-shaped variable` :math:`s` is defined. So, we
initialize the `state` as:

.. code-block:: python

    num_pre = pre_neu.num
    num_post = post_neu.num
    num_syn = len(pre_ids)
    delay = 2.  # ms

    state = nn.initial_syn_state(delay, num_pre, num_post, num, num_syn_shape_var=1)

The update function and the decay function of variable :math:`s` are defined 
according to Equation (2)

.. code-block:: python

    @nn.integrate(method='euler')
    def int_f(s, t):
        return - s / tau_decay

    def update_state(syn_state, t, val_index):
        # get pre-synaptic spikes
        spike_idx = np.where(syn_state[0][0] > 0.)[0]
        
        # evolve the synaptic state
        s = int_f(syn_state[2][0], t)
        
        # add the spike value to synapses
        for i in spike_idx:
            idx = anchors[:, i]
            s[idx[0]: idx[1]] += 1
        syn_state[2][0] = s
        
        # get the post-synaptic values
        g = np.zeros(num_post)
        for i in range(num_pre):
            idx = anchors[:, i]
            post_idx = post_ids[idx[0]: idx[1]]
            g[post_idx] += s[idx[0]: idx[1]]
        
        # record the delayed conductance
        record_conductance(syn_state, var_index, g)


The output function is defined according to Equation (2)

.. code-block:: python

    def output_synapse(syn_state, var_index, post_neu_state):
        # get the conductance output index
        output_idx = var_index[-2]
        
        # get the conductance
        g_val = syn_state[output_idx[0]][output_idx[1]]
        
        # Equation (2)
        post_val = - g_max * g_val * (post_neu_state[0] - E)
        
        # add computed value to post-synaptic neuron's input receiver
        post_neu_state[-1] += post_val

Put them together, we get the full model of the
`AMPA synapse <https://github.com/chaoming0625/NumpyBrain/blob/master/npbrain/synapses/AMPA_synapses.py>`_ .
