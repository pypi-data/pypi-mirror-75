# Configure pip not to use binary wheels on PyPy 3, with the goal of
# stabilizing Travis CI builds. My trials in getting this to work:
#
# 1. I struggled to work around several issues involving pip using wheels on
#    PyPy 3 but subsequently "crashing" (tracebacks) in one of several ways due
#    to the use of wheels.
#
# 2. After wasting quite a few more hours than I care to admit on (1) I decided
#    to preserve my sanity by "giving in" and just disabling wheels on PyPy 3
#    altogether. This seemed like a simple solution, but it wasn't ðŸ˜‡.
#
# 3. Unfortunately even (2) is not enough, because some of our requirements use
#    the "setup_requires" feature. This used to be handled by setuptools, but
#    nowadays it's handled by a nested pip process, and that will try to use
#    wheels even when the parent process received the "--no-binary=:all:"
#    command line option ðŸ˜ž. I guess this is a bug in the packaging ecosystem
#    (I assume pip) but that doesn't really help me at this point.
#
# 4. To work around (3) some of the "transitive build requirements" are listed
#    in requirements-tests.txt which means they're installed by the top level
#    pip process which does respect the "--no-binary=:all:" option.
#
# Here's an overview of my weekend of experimentation to find a way
# to successfully set up a usable py2deb test environment for PyPy 3:
