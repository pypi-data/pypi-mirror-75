        Constructing accurate subject specific head model is of main interest in the fields of source imaging (EEG/MEG) and brain stimulation (tDCS/tMS). shamo is an open source python package to calculate EEG leadfields, current flows, and electric potential distribution in the head. From a labelled 3D image of the head, the whole process is fully automatized, relying only on a few parameter files, e.g. conductivities (including white matter anisotropy) plus source and electrode locations. Since there is no non-invasive method to measure the electromagnetic (EM) properties of the head tissues, shamo can also be used to assess the sensitivity of the EM head model to these parameters.
