## ü§ñ Using SpellBot

Once you've connected the bot to your server, you can interact with it over
Discord via the following commands in any of the authorized channels. **Keep in
mind that sometimes SpellBot will respond to you via Direct Message to avoid
being too spammy in text channels.**

- `!help`: Provides detailed help about all of the following commands.
- `!about`: Get information about SpellBot and its creators.

### ‚úã Looking For Game

For players just looking to start some games, these commands are for you!

- `!lfg`: Create a pending game for people join.
- `!play`: Same as `!lfg`, but look for an existing game to join first.
- `!leave`: Leave any pending games that you've signed up for.

When you run the `!lfg` command, SpellBot will post a message for sign ups.

![lfg][lfg]

Other users can react to it with the ‚ûï emoji to be added to the game. When the
game is ready, SpellBot will update the message with your SpellTable details.

![ready][ready]

Users can also use the ‚ûñ emoji reaction to leave the game.

### üéüÔ∏è Commands for Event Runners

These commands are intended to be run by SpellBot Admins and help facilitate
online events.

- `!game`: Directly create games for the mentioned users.
- `!event`: Create a bunch of games all at once based on some uploaded data.
- `!begin`: Start an event that you previously created with `!event`.
- `!export`: Export historical game data for your server.

### üëë Administrative Commands

These commands will help you configure SpellBot for your server.

- `!spellbot`: This command allows admins to configure SpellBot for their
               server. It supports the following subcommands:
  - `config`: Just show the current configuration for this server.
  - `channels`: Set the channels SpellBot is allowed to operate within.
  - `prefix`: Set the command prefix for SpellBot in text channels.
  - `expire`: Set how many minutes before games are expired due to inactivity.

### ü§´ Secrets

There's some secret hidden features of SpellBot. For example if you use the
tags `~mtgo` or `~arena` when creating a game, it will direct players to use
those systems instead of SpellTable. Ok, I guess that's not secret anymore. But
you kinda get the idea. Well, you've been warned. Hopefully these features are
intuitive and helpful ü§û ‚Äî and if not,
[please report bugs and request features][issues] to your heart's content.

## üôå Support Me

I'm keeping SpellBot running using my own money but if you like the bot and want
to help me out, please consider donating to [my Ko-fi][ko-fi].

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing

If you'd like to become a part of the SpellBot development community please
first know that we have a documented [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
then see our [documentation on how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details
on how to get started.

## üîß Running SpellBot Yourself

First install `spellbot` using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```shell
pip install spellbot
```

Provide your Discord bot token with the environment variable `SPELLBOT_TOKEN`.
As well as your SpellTable API authorization token via `SPELLTABLE_AUTH`. You
can get [your bot token from Discord][discord-bot-docs]. As for the SpellTable
API authorization token, you'll have to talk to the SpellTable developers.
You can join their Discord server by
[becoming a SpellTable patron][spelltable-patron].

By default SpellBot will use sqlite3 as its database. You can however choose to
use another database by providing a [SQLAlchemy Connection URL][db-url]. This
can be done via the `--database-url` command line option or the environment
variable `SPELLBOT_DB_URL`. Note that, at the time of this writing, SpellBot is
only tested against sqlite3 and PostgreSQL.

More usage help can be found by running `spellbot --help`.

## üê≥ Docker Support

You can also run SpellBot via docker. See
[our documentation on Docker Support](DOCKER.md) for help.
