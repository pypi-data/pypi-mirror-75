Developer Notes
===============
    
Branches
--------

The next release is developed in the `nextrelease` branch.  When ready, the changes are merged into the `master` branch.

A copy of the 1.x release series is maintained in the 1.x branch.

Demo outputs are stored in the `demos` branch.


Install Alternatives
--------------------

Installing from source may require upgrading `setuptools` by executing

    pip install --upgrade setuptools

as root (or under sudo).

There are a few different options for installing from source:
    
1) To install from the github `master` branch use:

       pip install git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos.git --user

   (to upgrade append the `--upgrade` flag).

2) To install from the `nextrelease` branch on github, use

       pip install git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos.git@nextrelease --user

   (to upgrade use the --upgrade flag).

3) To install from a local source distribution, `cd` into its root
   and use

       pip install -e . --user

   Note that any changes made to the source will be automatically
   reflected when the filter is run (which is useful for development).


Testing
-------

Regression tests for pandoc-eqnos are provided in `test/`.  Read the README.md in that directory for instructions.


Preparing a Release
-------------------

These are notes for release managers.


### Merging ####

Merge the `nextrelease` branch into `master` using

    git checkout master
    git merge nextrelease
    git push


### Updating Demos ###

Starting from the root of the `master` branch, update demos in the `demos` branch using

    cd demos
    make -B
    git checkout demos
    cp -rf out/* ..
    git commit --amend -am "Updated demos."
    git push --force

This procedure ensures that there will only be a single revision of each file (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/22827188).


### Tagging ###

See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/ for numbering conventions, including for pre-releases.

Check that you are in the `master` branch.

Tagging  (update the version number):

    git tag -a 2.2.3 -m "New release."
    git push origin 2.2.3


### Distributing ###

Create source and binary distributions using

    python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

(see https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
    
Upload to pypi (update the version number) using

    twine upload dist/pandoc-eqnos-2.2.3.tar.gz \
                 dist/pandoc_eqnos-2.2.3-py3-none-any.whl

(see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine).
