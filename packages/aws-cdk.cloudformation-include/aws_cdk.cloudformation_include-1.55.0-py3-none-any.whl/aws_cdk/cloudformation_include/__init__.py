<!--END STABILITY BANNER-->

This module contains a set of classes whose goal is to facilitate working
with existing CloudFormation templates in the CDK.
It can be thought of as an extension of the capabilities of the
[`CfnInclude` class](../@aws-cdk/core/lib/cfn-include.ts).

## Basic usage

Assume we have a file with an existing template. It could be in JSON format, in a file `my-template.json`:

```json
{
  "Resources": {
    "Bucket": {
      "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
      "Properties": {
        "BucketName": "some-bucket-name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or it could by in YAML format, in a file `my-template.yaml`:

```yaml
Resources:
  Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: some-bucket-name
```

It can be included in a CDK application with the following code:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.cloudformation_include as cfn_inc

cfn_template = cfn_inc.CfnInclude(self, "Template",
    template_file="my-template.json"
)
```

Or, if our template is YAML, we can use

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cfn_template = cfn_inc.CfnInclude(self, "Template",
    template_file="my-template.yaml"
)
```

This will add all resources from `my-template.json` into the CDK application,
preserving their original logical IDs from the template file.

Any resource from the included template can be retrieved by referring to it by its logical ID from the template.
If you know the class of the CDK object that corresponds to that resource,
you can cast the returned object to the correct type:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3

cfn_bucket = cfn_template.get_resource("Bucket")
```

Any modifications made to that resource will be reflected in the resulting CDK template;
for example, the name of the bucket can be changed:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
cfn_bucket.bucket_name = "my-bucket-name"
```

You can also refer to the resource when defining other constructs,
including the higher-level ones
(those whose name does not start with `Cfn`),
for example:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_iam as iam

role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.AnyPrincipal()
)
role.add_to_policy(iam.PolicyStatement(
    actions=["s3:*"],
    resources=[cfn_bucket.attr_arn]
))
```

If you need, you can also convert the CloudFormation resource to a higher-level
resource by importing it by its name:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
bucket = s3.Bucket.from_bucket_name(self, "L2Bucket", cfn_bucket.ref)
```

Note that [Custom Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cfn-customresource.html)
will be of type CfnResource, and hence won't need to be casted.
This holds for any resource that isn't in the CloudFormation schema.

## Conditions

If your template uses [CloudFormation Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.html),
you can retrieve them from your template:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.core as core

condition = cfn_template.get_condition("MyCondition")
```

The `CfnCondition` object is mutable,
and any changes you make to it will be reflected in the resulting template:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
condition.expression = core.Fn.condition_equals(1, 2)
```

## Outputs

If your template uses [CloudFormation Outputs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html),
you can retrieve them from your template:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.core as core

output = cfn_template.get_output("MyOutput")
```

The `CfnOutput` object is mutable,
and any changes you make to it will be reflected in the resulting template:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
output.value = cfn_bucket.attr_arn
```

## Nested Stacks

This module also support templates that use [nested stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html).

For example, if you have the following parent template:

```json
{
  "Resources": {
    "ChildStack": {
      "Type": "AWS::CloudFormation::Stack",
      "Properties": {
        "TemplateURL": "https://my-s3-template-source.s3.amazonaws.com/child-import-stack.json",
        "Parameters": {
          "MyBucketParameter": "my-bucket-name"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

where the child template pointed to by `https://my-s3-template-source.s3.amazonaws.com/child-import-stack.json` is:

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "MyBucketParameter": {
      "Type": "String",
      "Default": "default-bucket-param-name"
    }
  },
  "Resources": {
    "BucketImport": {
      "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
      "Properties": {
        "BucketName": {
          "Ref": "MyBucketParameter"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can include both the parent stack and the nested stack in your CDK Application as follows:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
parent_template = inc.CfnInclude(stack, "ParentStack",
    template_file="path/to/my-parent-template.json",
    nested_stacks={
        "ChildStack": {
            "template_file": "path/to/my-nested-template.json"
        }
    }
)
```

Now you can access the ChildStack nested stack and included template with:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
included_child_stack = parent_template.get_nested_stack("ChildStack")
child_stack = included_child_stack.stack
child_stack_template = included_child_stack.included_template
```

Now you can reference resources from `ChildStack` and modify them like any other included template:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
bucket = child_stack_template.get_resource("MyBucket")
bucket.bucket_name = "my-new-bucket-name"

bucket_read_role = iam.Role(child_stack, "MyRole",
    assumed_by=iam.AccountRootPrincipal()
)

bucket_read_role.add_to_policy(iam.PolicyStatement(
    actions=["s3:GetObject*", "s3:GetBucket*", "s3:List*"
    ],
    resources=[bucket.attr_arn]
))
```
