# gaussian_binomial_distributions_bkim00 package

Summary of the package:

This package holds code that will allow for users to create objects of Gaussian and Binomial distributions

# Files

Generaldistribution.py is the parent class for Gaussian and Binomial distributions to be based off of.

Gaussiandistribution.py is the class for Gaussian distributions. Users will be able to get the mean and standard deviation
	of Gaussian distributions. They will also be able to sum Gaussian distributions together.
    
Binomialdistribution.py is the class for Binomial distributions. Users will be able to get the mean and standard deviation 
	of Binomial distributions. They will also be able to sum two Binomial distributions togther.
