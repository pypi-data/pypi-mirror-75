# Gitlab Cloner

This is a program that clones all git repositories of a user from a
Gitlab server.

This requires the user's API access token.

## Usage

Use the Gitlab Server's URL as the first positional argument, the second 
one should be the API key.

You can also specify a destination directory for the repositories
with the ```-d``` argument.
