    r""" Returns the per-datum focal loss as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002
    which is given by -ɑ(1-p)ˠlog(p).

    Extended Description
    --------------------
    The focal loss is given by

    .. math::
        \frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{1}^{N}-\alpha \hat{y}_i(1-p_i)^\gamma\log(p_i)

    where :math:`N` is the number of elements in `x` and `y` and :math:`\hat{y}_i` is
    one where :math:`i` is the label of the element :math:`y_i` and 0 elsewhere. That is,
    if the label :math:`y_k` is 1 and there are four possible label values, then
    :math:`\hat{y}_k = (0, 1, 0, 0)`.

    It is recommended in the paper that you normalize by the number of foreground samples.

    r"""
    Applies the softmax normalization to the input scores before computing the
    per-datum focal loss.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores : mygrad.Tensor, shape=(N, C)
        The C class scores for each of the N pieces of data.

    targets : array_like, shape=(N,)
        The correct class indices, in [0, C), for each datum.

    alpha : Real, optional (default=1)
        The ɑ weighting factor in the loss formulation.

    gamma : Real, optional (default=0)
        The ɣ focusing parameter. Note that for Ɣ=0 and ɑ=1, this is cross-entropy loss.

    constant : bool, optional(default=False)
        If ``True``, the returned tensor is a constant (it
        does not back-propagate a gradient)

    Returns
    -------
    mygrad.Tensor, shape=(N,)
        The per-datum focal loss.

    Notes

    The formulation for the focal loss introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.
