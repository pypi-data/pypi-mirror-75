## Details

The values for `Element.mass` were taken from the abridged standard atomic weights (Table 2), with the following exceptions:

* When a range of atomic weights was presented, the value was taken from Table 3 (conventional atomic weights).
* When an abridged standard atomic weight was not provided, the value was taken as the mass number of the longest-lived isotopes (Table 4).

These choices follow the convention used for the [NIST periodic table](
