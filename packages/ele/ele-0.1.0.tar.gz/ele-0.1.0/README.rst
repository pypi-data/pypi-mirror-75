Overview
~~~~~~~~

**Ele**\ ment is an extremely lightweight package that defines
the elements of the periodic table and allows them to be accessed
by symbol, name, atomic number, or mass. It has *zero dependencies*
outside of the Python Standard Library.

Warning
~~~~~~~

**Ele** is still in early development (0.x releases). The API may
change unexpectedly.

Usage
~~~~~

**Ele** only supports a few modes of use. You can retrieve an element
from the symbol, the name, the atomic number, or the mass (in amu):

.. code-block:: python

  import ele
  na = ele.element_from_symbol("Na")
  na = ele.element_from_name("sodium")
  na = ele.element_from_atomic_number(11)
  na = ele.element_from_mass(22.990)

The mass is rounded to a single decimal before comparison. If you wish to
retrieve the element with the mass closest to the specified value you
may use the ``exact=False`` keyword.

Each ``Element`` has four attributes which can be accessed
(as demonstrated below for ``na``):

.. code-block:: python

  na.name
  na.symbol
  na.atomic_number
  na.mass

The elements can also be accessed by symbol as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import ele
  na = ele.Elements.Na

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installation is currently limited to source:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  git clone git@github.com/rsdefever/ele.git
  cd ele
  pip install .

``pip`` and ``conda`` installations are coming soon!
