Over the years, you have accumulated many—far too many—programs and code snippets that may be of interest to your students.\n\nOr, as a seasoned developer, you would like to share your knowledge by helping a loved one learn how to code. A cursory search for pedagogical material yields an overwhelming amount of websites and repositories stuffed with Python programs of various levels (e.g.,\n[1](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python),\n[2](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Python),\n[3](https://www.programming-idioms.org/about#about-block-language-coverage),\n[4](https://github.com/codebasics/py),\n[5](https://github.com/keon/algorithms),\n[6](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/Python-Programs),\nand a lot more from [Awesome Python in Education](https://github.com/quobit/awesome-python-in-education)).\n\nIn any case, the Python source codes you have gathered are typically\n**numerous** (hundreds or even thousands),\n**reasonably sized** (anything below 1000 SLOC),\nand **educational** in nature (e.g., snippets, examples, quizzes, exercise solutions, classic algorithms).\nThe programming concepts you plan to teach remain relatively **low level** (e.g. assignments, nested loops, accumulation patterns, tail-recursive functions, etc.).\n\nIf all that sounds familiar, keep reading me to see what Paroxython can do for you.\n\n#### Main goals\n\nParoxython aims to help you select, from your collection, the one program that suits your needs. For instance, it will gladly answer the following questions:\n\n> - How can this concept be illustrated?\n> - What problems use the same algorithmic and data structures as this one?\n> - What homework assignment should I give my students so they can practice the content of the last lesson?\n\nSince it knows what your class knows, it can recommend the right program at the right time:\n\n> - What would make a good review exercise?\n> - Which exercises can I give on this exam?\n> - What is the current learning cost of this example?\n\nIn the long run, it may guide you and somehow make you rethink your course outline:\n\n> - What are the prerequisites for the concept of assignment?\n> - Do I have enough material to introduce subroutines before I even talk about conditionals and loops?\n> - Among the loops, which must come first: the most powerful (`while`), or the most useful (`for`)?\n> - How to logically structure this bunch of usual iterative patterns?\n> - What are the _basics_, exactly?\n\nAll issues on which the author changed his mind since he started to work on this project!\n\nIn an ideal world, Paroxython could even put an end to the deadliest religious wars, with rational, data-driven arguments:\n\n> - Father, is it a sin to exit early?\n> - Should a real byte use a mask?\n\n#### How it works\n\n```plain\nSpecifications\n     +\n   Programs  →  Labels\n                  +\n               Taxonomy  →  Tag database\n                                +\n                          Command pipeline  →  Recommendations\n```\n\nParoxython starts by building a **tag database** from a given folder of **programs**. Tagging these programs is a two-step process:\n\n- First, all features that meet the provided **specifications** are identified by free-form internal-use **labels** (e.g., `assignment_lhs_identifier:a` or `loop_with_late_exit:while`), and associated with their spanning lines (e.g., 4 or 5-7).\n- These labels are then mapped onto a knowledge **taxonomy** designed with basic hierarchical constraints in mind (e.g., the fact that the introduction of the concept of early exit must come after that of loop, which itself requires that of control flow, is expressed with the following taxon: `flow/loop/exit/early`).\n\nThe tag database can finally be filtered through a **pipeline of commands**, for instance:\n    - _include_ only the programs which feature a recursive function;\n    - _exclude_ this or that program which you are reserving for the exam;\n    - “_impart_” all programs studied so far, _i.e_, consider that all the notions they implement are acquired.\n\nThe result is a list of program **recommendations** ordered by increasing learning cost.\n\nNote that the label specification file is provided. For converting labels to taxa, a default taxonomy is also provided, but you may feel the need to tailor it to your own vision of the course. Initially, the pipeline can be left empty: the recommendations will then cover all programs, sorted by increasing level of knowledge.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose that the directory `programs` contains [these simple programs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms). First, build [this tag database](https://github.com/laowantong/paroxython/blob/master/examples/simple/programs_db.json):\n\n```shell\n> paroxython collect programs\nLabelling 21 programs.\nMapping taxonomy on 21 programs.\nWriting programs_db.json.\n```\n\nThen, filter it through [this pipeline](https://github.com/laowantong/paroxython/blob/master/examples/simple/programs_pipe.py):\n\n```shell\n> paroxython recommend -p programs_pipe.py programs_db.json\nProcessing 5 commands on 21 programs.\n  19 programs remaining after operation 1 (impart).\n  18 programs remaining after operation 2 (exclude).\n  12 programs remaining after operation 3 (exclude).\n  10 programs remaining after operation 4 (include).\n  10 programs remaining after operation 5 (hide).\nDumped: programs_recommendations.md.\n```\n\nEt voilà [your recommendation report](https://github.com/laowantong/paroxython/blob/master/examples/simple/programs_recommendations.md)!\n\n----\n\n### Installation and test-drive\n\n#### Command line\n\nMuch to no one's surprise:\n\n```\npip install paroxython\n```\n\nThe following command should print a help message and exit:\n\n```\nparoxython --help\n```\n\n#### IPython magic command\n\nIf you use Jupyter notebook/lab, you've also just installed a so-called magic command. Load it like this:\n\n```python\n%load_ext paroxython\n```\n\nAnd run it on a cell of Python code (line numbers added for clarity):\n\n```python\n1   %%paroxython\n2   def fibonacci(n):\n3       result = []\n4       (a, b) = (0, 1)\n5       while a < n:\n6           result.append(a)\n7           (a, b) = (b, a + b)\n8       return result\n```\n\n| Taxon | Lines |\n|:--|:--|\n| `call/method/append` | 6 |\n| `flow/loop/exit/late` | 5-7 |\n| `flow/loop/while` | 5-7 |\n| `metadata/program` | 2-8 |\n| `metadata/sloc/8` | 2-8 |\n| `operator/arithmetic/addition` | 7 |\n| `subroutine/argument/arg` | 2 |\n| `subroutine/function` | 2-8 |\n| `test/inequality` | 5 |\n| `type/number/integer/literal` | 4 |\n| `type/number/integer/literal/zero` | 4 |\n| `type/sequence/list` | 6 |\n| `type/sequence/list/literal/empty` | 3 |\n| `type/sequence/tuple/literal` | 4, 4, 7, 7 |\n| `variable/assignment/parallel` | 4 |\n| `variable/assignment/parallel/slide` | 7 |\n| `variable/assignment/single` | 3 |\n\n## Further reading\n\n- [User manual](https://laowantong.github.io/paroxython/docs_user_manual/index.html)\n- [Developer manual](https://laowantong.github.io/paroxython/docs_developer_manual/index.html)\n- [Module reference](https://laowantong.github.io/paroxython/#header-submodules)\n",
