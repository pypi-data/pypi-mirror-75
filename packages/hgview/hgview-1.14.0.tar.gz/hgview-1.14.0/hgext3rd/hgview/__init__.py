start hgview log viewer
=======================

    This command will launch the hgview log navigator, allowing to
    visually browse in the hg graph log, search in logs, and display
    diff between arbitrary revisions of a file.

    If a filename is given, launch the filelog diff viewer for this file,
    and with the '-n' option, launch the filelog navigator for the file.

    With the '-r' option, launch the manifest viewer for the given revision.
