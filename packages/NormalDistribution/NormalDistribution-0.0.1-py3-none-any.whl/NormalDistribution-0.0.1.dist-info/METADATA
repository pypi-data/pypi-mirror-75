This package is created for statistical analysis and for machine learning 
least square linear rigression model cost function evaluation by Normal
(Gussian) distribution. It also can be use to calculate the mean and standard  
deviation of a data set.

It has two classes
class Distribution: This contains two methods
    method(class attributes)
    method data_loader(file): This takes in a file in text format and append
    the data to a data list for calculations.

class Normal: This contains six methods
    methods calculate_mean(), calculate_std(), distribution_plot(),
    normal_distribution(x), add_distribution(other), total_distribution()

    calculate_mean() returns the mean of the data set.

    calculate_std() returns the standard deviation of the data set.

    distribution_plot() returns the gussian plot of the data set.

    normal_distribution() returns the Gussian distribution value for a given
    point.

    to add two normal distributions together, add_distribution(other) where 
    other=Gussian returns the mean and standard deviation for the multiple 
    distribution

    total_distribution() returns the mean and the standard deviation for the 
    combined distribution
