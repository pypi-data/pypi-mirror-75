# flake8-assert-msg

flake8 plugin which forbids assert statements without messages.

## Installation

## flake8 codes

| Code   | Description             |
|--------|-------------------------|
| ASS001 | do not use bare asserts |

## Rationale

This ensures that assertions have clear messages for failures. Adding a message to an assertion also acts as documentation for why the assertion is present.
