Description: Parse Grammar
        =============
        
        A library containing Directed Graph representing symbol to symbol translation with a Grammar class representing a start symbol and any terminal symbols.
        
        Used for representing finite state machines in automation bots.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        `import grammar as gram`
        
        `pGraph = gram.Graph()`
        
        `pGrammar = gram.Grammar(<start_symbol>, <end_symbol>, pGraph)`
        
        where <start_symbol> is a vertex within pGraph
        where <end_symbol> is a vertex, or list/set of verticies, within pGraph
        
        The <start_symbol> can not be an isolated vertex.
