Description
############

**Warning:** Currently only compatible with Python3 (>=3.6.1)

The purpose of this repository is to provide an ExoEdge protocol source that can get read EtherNet/IP tags from a PLC.

A protocol source (often just referred to as a "source") is the glue between ExoEdge and the field-bus that you want to get data to and from. It is helpful to think of a source as a plugin to ExoEdge.

This source utilizes the `pycomm3 <https://pypi.org/project/pycomm3/>`_ library and is subject to the same restrictions.


Install
#########

Installing a build can be done in several ways:

Installing From Source
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py install


Installing From Builds
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install dist/*.whl


Installing From Builds
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install exoedge_ethernetip

Usage
#########
Configure the channel in ExoSense by inputting an Application of 'EtherNetIP' and including both 'path' and 'tag' in the app_specfic_config

.. image:: images/EtherNetIP_Configuration.png

The `path` argument can take 3 forms:
 - IP Address Only (10.20.30.100) - Use if PLC is in slot 0 or if connecting to CompactLogix

 - IP Address/Slot (10.20.30.100/1) - Use if PLC is not in slot 0

 - CIP Routing Path (10.20.30.100/backplane/3/enet/10.20.40.100/backplane/0) - Use for more complex routing
