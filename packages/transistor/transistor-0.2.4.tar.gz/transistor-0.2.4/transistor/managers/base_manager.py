transistor.managers.base_manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module implements BaseWorkGroupManager as a fully functional base class
which can assign tasks and conduct a scrape job across an arbitrary number
of WorkGroups. Each WorkGroup can contain an arbitrary number of
Worker/Scrapers.

It's `tasks` parameter can accept a StatefulBook instance, which transforms
a spreadsheet column into keyword tasks search terms. The `tasks` parameter
can also accept an ExchangeQueue instance, which creates an AMQP compatable
exchange and queue, while BaseWorkGroupManager acts as a consumer/worker,
processing tasks from a broker like RabbitMQ or Redis.

Although this class is fully functional as-is. The monitor() method provides an
excellent hook point for post-scrape Worker manipulation. A more robust implementation
will subclass BaseManager and override the monitor method for customization.
