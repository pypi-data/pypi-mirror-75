Entry point to run the books_to_scrape example.

Note:

The primary use case where the current Transistor design shines, is when you need to
scrape websites which have a search functionality. These are generally non-paginated
websites, which you need to enter a search term, and then scrape the page which is
given by the server in response.

For the search term use case, this design is good. You can send an arbitrary number
of workers to the search page. Each worker has one task issued, a task to execute the
search for the term it has been assigned, and return to us with the response.

The example highlighted here, employs a "crawl" mechanism inside each
of the scraper objects. This is not really showcasing the optimal use case for
a Transistor SplashScraper with Manager/WorkGroups, per the current design.

The reason is, in this example, we send out 20 workers at once. Each worker
crawls through EACH PAGE on the books.toscrape.com website, until the worker finds
the book title it has been dispatched to find.  There are only 50 pages on the
books.toscrape.com website. Meanwhile, this design we've used here, results in us
crawling hundreds of pages, considering each page that each of 20 workers will crawl.

It gets the job done. But, this design results in a comparatively heavy load on
the target server. Versus, an alternative design, which could use only one worker
to crawl each web page, searching each page for a book_title which matches a
book title in it's work queue, gathering the data for each matched book title, as it
crawls from page to next-page.

The total crawl time would be about the same. But, the alternative design using only
one worker to crawl each page and collect multiple results per page as they are found,
would have crawled a lot less pages in total, bringing some potential net benefit. Even
if the benefit is just reducing the risk of irritating the target server webmaster.

# deployed, through the `pool` parameter. For example, this is useful
# when using a Crawlera 'C10' plan which limits concurrency to 10. To deploy all
# the workers concurrently, set the pool +1 higher than the number of total
# workers assigned in groups in step #3 above. The +1 is for pool manager.
