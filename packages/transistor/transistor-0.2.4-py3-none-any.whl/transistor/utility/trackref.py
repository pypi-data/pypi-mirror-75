"""
transistor.utility.trackref
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module provides some functions and classes to record and report
references to live object instances.

If you want live objects for a particular class to be tracked, you only have to
subclass from object_ref (instead of object).

About performance: This library has a minimal performance impact when enabled,
and no performance penalty at all when disabled (as object_ref becomes just an
alias to object in that case).

This code was originally copied from the Scrapy.utils.trackref module. It was
then modified to remove six, because we are not supporting python 2.
