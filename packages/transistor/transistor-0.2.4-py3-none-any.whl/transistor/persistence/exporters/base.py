This module implements classes that extract (serialize) the data inside
a BaseWorker from a SplashScraper.

Most of this module is heavily inspired or else copied from Scrapy.

"""
from transistor.persistence.loader import ItemLoader

__all__ = ['BaseItemExporter']


class BaseItemExporter:
    """
    This is the base class for all Item Exporters. It provides
    support for common features used by all (concrete) Item Exporters,
    such as defining what fields to export, whether to export empty fields,
    or which encoding to use.

    These features can be configured through the constructor arguments
    which populate their respective instance attributes: fields_to_export,
    export_empty_fields, encoding, indent.

    Further, in Transistor, currently the Scrapy equivalent to
    `Item Loader` is built into this `BaseItemExporter`
    class, in the `write` method.

    An Item Exporter is BaseWorker tool to export the data from the
    SplashScraper object and pass the data into a new object which
    inherits from class:Item, called 'items' here.

    A spider which has completed a scrape job goes in. A container object
    encapsulating all the relevant data we want to further manipulate or
    save from the scrape job, comes out.

    So Transistor's BaseItemExporter.write() is roughly equivalent to
    Scrapy's ItemLoader.load_item() method.

    Transistor does not yet have an equivalent to Scrapy's concept of
    `Item Pipeline`, which uses multiple `Item Exporters` to group scraped
    items to different files according to the value of one of their fields.

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        """
        Create an instance.
        :param kwargs: fields_to_export::list(): A list with the name
        of the fields that will be exported, or None if you want to export
        all fields. Defaults to None. Some exporters (like CsvItemExporter)
        respect the order of the fields defined in this attribute. Some
        exporters may require fields_to_export list in order to export
        the data properly when spiders return dicts (not Item instances).
        :param kwargs: export_empty_fields: Whether to include
        empty/unpopulated item fields in the exported data. Defaults to
        False. Some exporters (like CsvItemExporter) ignore this attribute
        and always export all empty fields. This option is ignored for
        dict items.
        :param kwargs: encoding: defaults to 'utf-8'. The encoding that
        will be used to encode unicode values. This only affects unicode
        values (which are always serialized to str using this encoding).
        Other value types are passed unchanged to the specific serialization
        library.
        :param kwargs: ident: Amount of spaces used to indent the output on
        each level. Defaults to 0. `indent=None` selects the most compact
        representation, all items in the same line with no indentation
        `indent<=0` each item on its own line, no indentation
        `indent>0` each item on its own line, indented with the provided
        numeric value

        By default, this method looks for a serializer declared in the
        item field and returns the result of applying that serializer to
        the value. If no serializer is found, it returns the value unchanged.
