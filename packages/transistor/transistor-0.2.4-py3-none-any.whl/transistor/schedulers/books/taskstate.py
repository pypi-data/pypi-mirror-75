class _TaskState:
    """
    Store the state of task items for each website WorkGroup/Worker/Scraper set.

    For example, lets suppose we have a list of 100 different manufacturing part
     numbers for electronic components. We want to search each part number on six
     different website domains. After searching, we're going to scrape the result.
     So, we need to do 600 searches, 100 different searches on each of six websites.

      WEBSITE                Scrape Tasks
    - mousekey.com.cn           x 100
    - mousekey.com              x 100
    - digidog.com.cn            x 100
    - digidog.com               x 100
    - electricfuture.cn         x 100
    - electricfuture.com        x 100

    From a messaging queuing and task assignment point of view, the structure
    of the required solution is called `Fanout`.  We have some `producer` that
    creates the initial 100 different manufacturing part numbers (mpn's). Then,
    we deliver those mpn's to an `exchange` (the StatefulBook class). The
    StatefulBook class creates a `queue` for each of the workers which will
    scrape the website, containing the same 100 mpns.

    Further, we ultimately want to track the state of each of the 100 part number
    searches on each website. So we can have conversations like, "Do we have results
    for part number xyz1 on website 'mousekey.com' and 'digifuture.com'? How do
    they compare? Darn it, the search on 'digifuture.com' failed. We need to
    retry it or else investigate why the search failed."

    trackers = ['mousekey.com.cn', 'mousekey.com', 'digidog.com.cn', 'digidog.com',
    'electricfuture.cn', 'electricfuture.com']

    We want to keep track of the task status state of each part number search, for
    each website we scrape.
