ðŸš¨ **This package is under heavy development and breaking changes are likely to happen.** ðŸš¨

Features
--------

PyDaymet is a part of `Hydrodata <https://github.com/cheginit/hydrodata>`__ software stack
and provides an interface to access daily climate data through the
`Daymet <https://daymet.ornl.gov/>`__ RESTful service. Both single pixel and gridded data
can be requested which are returned as ``pandas.DataFrame`` for single pixel and
``xarray.Dataset`` for gridded data. Additionally, it can compute Potential EvapoTranspiration
(PET) using `UN-FAO 56 paper <http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/X0490E00.htm>`__
method for both single pixel and gridded data.


You can try using PyDaymet without installing it on you system by clicking on the binder badge
below the PyDaymet banner. A Jupyter notebook instance with the Hydrodata software stack
pre-installed will be launched in your web browser and you can start coding!

Moreover, requests for additional functionalities can be submitted via
`issue tracker <https://github.com/cheginit/pydaymet/issues>`__.

Installation
------------

You can install pydaymet using ``pip`` after installing ``libgdal`` on your system
(for example, in Ubuntu run ``sudo apt install libgdal-dev``):

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pydaymet

Alternatively, pydaymet can be installed from the ``conda-forge`` repository
using `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c conda-forge pydaymet

Quickstart
----------

PyDaymet offers two functions for getting climate data; ``get_byloc`` and ``get_bygeom``.
The arguments of these function are identical except that the first argument of the latter
should be polygon and the former a coordinate (a tuple of length two as in (x, y)). The input
geometry or coordinates can be any valid CRS and by default EPSG:4326 is considered as the
input CRS. It is noted that both functions have a ``pet`` flag for computing PET.

.. code-block:: python

    from pynhd import NLDI
    import pydaymet as daymet

    dates = ("2000-01-01", "2000-06-12")
    variables = ["prcp", "tmin"]

    geometry = NLDI.getfeature_byid("nwissite", "USGS-01031500", basin=True).geometry[0]
    clm_g = daymet.get_bygeom(geometry, dates=dates, variables=variables, pet=True)

    coords = (-1431147.7928, 318483.4618)
    crs = "epsg:3542"
    clm_p = daymet.get_byloc(coords, crs=crs, dates=dates, variables=variables, pet=True)
