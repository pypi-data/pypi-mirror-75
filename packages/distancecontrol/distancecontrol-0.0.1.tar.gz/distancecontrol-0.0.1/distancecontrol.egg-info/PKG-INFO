Description: A library used to control programs(mainly games) without focusing them.  
        This isn't guaranteed to work and will sometimes require to be very creative with how you perform actions.  
        Example:
        ```
        hwnd = Windows_by_title('GamesTitle', strict=True)[0]
        
        # Open up menu(It doesn't close it)
        KeyPress_Down(hwnd, VK_ESCAPE)
        KeyPress_Up(hwnd, VK_ESCAPE)
        
        # Press the right key
        KeyPress_Down(hwnd, VK_RIGHT)
        KeyPress_StopAll(hwnd) # KeyPress_Up() won't work. Why? I don't know, for every program it's different.
        ```
        
        Module's functions are easy to understand.
