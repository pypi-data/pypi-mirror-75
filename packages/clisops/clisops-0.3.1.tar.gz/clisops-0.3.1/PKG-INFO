        The `clisops` package (pronounced "clie-sops") provides a python library for running
        _data-reduction_ operations on [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) data sets or files
        that can be interpreted by Xarray. These basic operations (subsetting, averaging and
        regridding) are likely to work where data structures are NetCDF-centric, such as those
        found in ESGF data sets.
        
        `clisops` is employed by the [daops](https://github.com/roocs/daops) library to perform
        its basic operations once `daops` has applied any necessary _fixes_ to data in order
        to remove irregularities/anomalies. Users are recommended to investigate using `daops`
        directly in order to access these _fixes_ which may affect the scientific credibility of
        the results.
        
        `clisops` can be used stand-alone to read individual, or groups of, NetCDF files directly.
