Description: # ulcarchetype
        
        ulcarchetype is a Python library that provides some simple tools to characterize the uncertainty due to archetype "underspecification" in life cycle assessment. Is meant to be used with the LCA software Brightway2. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ulcarchetype
        
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import brightway2 as bw
        from ulcarchetype.utils import get_cf_info,minmax_archetype,cf_add_uncertainty
        
        method = bw.methods.random()
        cf_df = get_cf_info(method) # returns a dataframe with data on characterisation factors
        minmax_archetype(cf_df) # returns a dataframe with data needed to define uncertain CFs
        # or simply
        cf_add_uncertainty(method) # returns a list of CFs taking into account archetype uncertainty
        ```
