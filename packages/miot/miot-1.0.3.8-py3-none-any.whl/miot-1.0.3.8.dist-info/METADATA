# CONFIGURE MQTT SERVER

This step is only required if you are installing MIOT on a different server than your MQTT broker or if you are using authentication (Which you should be).

    miot set mqtt.port 1883
    miot set mqtt.username MyUsername
    miot set mqtt.password MyPassword

# HOW TO USE IT

miot is a command-line utility that is used to control and configure your home automation modules.

You can view the help screen by typing any one of the following:
    miot --help
    miot -h
    miot /?

The next set of commands are used to control the modules you have selected to be part of your system. You can choose to install/uninstall, enable/disable or start/stop their services.

    miot install <module>
    miot remove <module>
    miot uninstall <module>
    miot enable <module>
    miot disable <module>
    miot start <module>
    miot stop <module>
    miot restart <module>
    miot status <module>

The following commands are only available after you have run 'miot setup':

Configuration of miot is performed from the command line (not by editing huge configuration files):

    miot set <key> <value>
    miot get <key>

After configuring MQTT, you can send low level MQTT messages:

    miot send [host] <topic> <message>

You can also use *miot* to snoop on MQTT messages:

    miot snoop [host] <topic>
