``nbgitpuller`` lets you distribute content in a git repository to your
students by having them click a simple link. `Automatic merging <https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/topic/automatic-merging.html>`_ ensures that your students are
never exposed to ``git`` directly. It is primarily used with a JupyterHub,
but can also work on students' local computers.
