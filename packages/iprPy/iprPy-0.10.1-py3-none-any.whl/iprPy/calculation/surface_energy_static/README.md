## Introduction

The surface_energy_static calculation style evaluates the formation energy for a free surface by slicing an atomic system along a specific plane.

### Version notes

- This was previously called the surface_energy calculation style and was renamed for consistency.

### Additional dependencies

### Disclaimers

- [NIST disclaimers](http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/disclaimer.cfm)
- Other atomic configurations at the free surface for certain planar cuts may have lower energies.  The atomic relaxation will find a local minimum, which may not be the global minimum.  Additionally, the material cut is planar perfect and therefore does not explore the effects of atomic roughness.
