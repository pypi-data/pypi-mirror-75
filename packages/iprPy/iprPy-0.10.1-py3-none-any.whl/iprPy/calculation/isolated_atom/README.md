## Introduction

The isolated_atom calculation style evaluates the energy of a single isolated atom of each element type associated with an iteratomic potential.  This value is important for correctly computing the cohesive energy of a crystal with some interatomic potentials, and can serve as a simple test if a potential implementation works with a given version of LAMMPS.
