## Introduction

The diatom_scan calculation style evaluates the interaction energy between two atoms at varying distances.  This provides a measure of the isolated pair interaction of two atoms providing insights into the strengths of the attraction/repulsion and the effective range of interatomic spacings.  This scan also gives insight into the computational smoothness of the potential's functional form.
