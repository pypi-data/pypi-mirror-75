## Input script parameters

This is a list of the input parameter names recognized by the calculation script.

### Initial system configuration to load

Provides the information associated with loading an atomic configuration.

- __load_file__: the path to the initial configuration file being read in.

- __load_style__: the style/format for the load_file.  The style can be any file type supported by atomman.load()

- __load_options__: a list of key-value pairs for the optional style-dependent arguments used by atomman.load().

- __family__: specifies the configuration family to associate with the loaded file.  This is typically a crystal structure/prototype identifier that helps with linking calculations on the same material together.  If not given and the load_style is system_model, then the family will be taken from the file if included.  Otherwise, the family will be taken as load_file stripped of path and extension.

- __symbols__: a space-delimited list of the potential's atom-model symbols to associate with the loaded system's atom types.  Required if load_file does not contain this information.

- __box_parameters__: allows for the specification of new box parameters to scale the loaded configuration by.  This is useful for running calculations based on prototype configurations that do not contain material-specific dimensions.  Can be given either as a list of three or six numbers, with an optional unit of length at the end.  If the unit of length is not given, the specified length_unit (below) will be used.

  - a b c (unit): for orthogonal boxes.

  - a b c alpha beta gamma (unit): for triclinic boxes.  The angles are taken in degrees.

### System manipulations

Performs simple manipulations on the loaded initial system.

- __a_uvw, b_uvw, c_uvw__: are crystallographic Miller vectors to rotate the system by such that the rotated system's a, b, c box vectors correspond to the specified Miller vectors of the loaded configuration.  Using crystallographic vectors for rotating ensures that if the initial configuration is periodic in all three directions, the resulting rotated configuration can be as well with no boundary incompatibilities.  Default values are '1 0 0', '0 1 0', and '0 0 1', respectively (i.e. no rotation).

### Defect Parameters

Defines the defect system to construct and analyze.

- __dislocation_file__: the path to a dislocation_monopole record file that contains a set of input parameters associated with a specific dislocation. In particular, the dislocation_monopole record contains values for the *a_uvw, b_uvw, c_uvw, atomshift, dislocation_stroh_m, dislocation_stroh_n, dislocation_lineboxvector,* and *dislocation_burgersvector* parameters. As such, those parameters cannot be specified separately if *pointdefect_model* is given.

- __dislocation_stroh_m__: three floating point numbers corresponding to the $m$ unit vector defining one of the two axes used by the Stroh method. $m$ must be perpendicular to the *dislocation_lineboxvector* and within the slip plane. Default value is '0 1 0'.

- __dislocation_stroh_n__: three floating point numbers corresponding to the $m$ unit vector defining one of the two axes used by the Stroh method. $n$ must be perpendicular to the *dislocation_lineboxvector* and normal to the slip plane. Default value is '0 0 1'.

- __dislocation_lineboxvector__: 'a', 'b', or 'c' specifying which of the three box vectors the dislocation line is made parallel to. Default value is 'a'.

- __dislocation_burgersvector__: three floating point numbers specifying the dislocation's Burgers vector in Crystallographic uvw units relative to the loaded system's box vectors.

- __dislocation_boundarywidth__: floating point number specifying the minimum thickness of the boundary region. This number is taken relative to the loaded system's $a$ box vector magnitude.

- __dislocation_boundaryshape__: 'box' or 'circle' specifying the resulting shape of the active region after defining the boundary atoms.  For 'box', the boundary width is constant at the two non-periodic box edges.  For 'circle', the active region is a cylinder centered around the dislocation line.  Default value is 'circle'.

- __gammasurface_file__: the path to a file that contains a data model associated with an atomman.defect.GammaSurface object. Within the iprPy framework, this can be a calculation_stacking_fault_map_2D record.

### Elastic constants parameters

Specifies the computed elastic constants for the interatomic potential and crystal structure, relative to the loaded system's orientation.

- __elasticconstants_file__: the path to a record containing the elastic constants to use.  If neither this or the individual Cij components (below) are given and *load_style* is 'system_model', this will be set to *load_file*.

- __C11, C12, C13, C14, C15, C16, C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C33, C34, C35, C36, C44, C45, C46, C55, C56, C66__: the individual elastic constants components in units of pressure.  If the loaded system's orientation is the standard setting for the crystal type, then missing values will automatically be filled in. Example: if the loaded system is a cubic prototype, then only *C11, C12* and *C44* need be specified.

### Units for input/output values

Specifies the units for various physical quantities to use when saving values to the results record file. Also used as the default units for parameters in this input parameter file.

- __length_unit__: defines the unit of length for results, and input parameters if not directly specified.  Default value is 'angstrom'.

- __energy_unit__: defines the unit of energy for results, and input parameters if not directly specified.  Default value is 'eV'.

- __pressure_unit__: defines the unit of pressure for results, and input parameters if not directly specified.  Default value is 'GPa'.

- __force_unit__: defines the unit of pressure for results, and input parameters if not directly specified.  Default value is 'eV/angstrom'.

### Run parameters

Provides parameters specific to the calculation at hand.  See atomman.defect.SDVPN documentation for more details on these parameters.

- __xmax__: The maximum value of the x-coordinates to use for the points where the disregistry is evaluated.  The solution is centered around x=0, therefore this also corresponds to the minimum value of x used.  The set of x-coordinates used is fully defined by giving at least two of xmax, xstep and xnum.

- __xstep__: The step size (delta x) value between the x-coordinates used to evaluate the disregistry.  The set of x-coordinates used is fully defined by giving at least two of xmax, xstep and xnum.

- __xnum__: The total number of x-coordinates at which to evaluate the disregistry.  The set of x-coordinates used is fully defined by giving at least two of xmax, xstep and xnum.

- __minimize_style__: The scipy.optimize.minimize method style to use when solving for the disregistry.  Default value is 'Powell', which seems to do decently well for this problem.

- __minimize_options__: Allows for the specification of the options dictionary used by scipy.optimize.minimize. This is given as "key value key value...".

- __minimize_cycles__: Specifies the number of times to run the minimization in succession.  The minimization algorithms used by the underlying scipy code often benefit from restarting and rerunning the minimized configuration to achive a better fit.  Default value is 10.

- __cutofflongrange__: The radial cutoff (in distance units) to use for the long-range elastic energy.  The long-range elastic energy is configuration-independent, so this value changes the dislocation's energy but not the computed disregistry profile. Default value is 1000 Angstroms.

- __tau_xy__: Shear stress (in units of pressure) to apply to the system. Default value is 0 GPa.

- __tau_yy__: Normal stress (in units of pressure) to apply to the system. Default value is 0 GPa.

- __tau_yz__: Shear stress (in units of pressure) to apply to the system. Default value is 0 GPa.

- __alpha__: Coefficient(s) (in pressure/length units) of the non-local energy correction term to use.  Default value is 0.0, meaning this correction is not applied.

- __beta_xx, beta_yy, beta_zz, beta_xy, beta_xz, beta_yz__: Components of the surface energy coefficient tensor (in units pressure-length) to use. Default value is 0.0 GPa-Angstrom for all, meaning this correction is not applied.

- __cdiffelastic, cdiffsurface, cdiffstress__: Booleans indicating how the dislocation density (derivative of disregistry) is computed within the elastic, surface and stress terms, respectively. If True, central difference is used, otherwise only the change between the current and previous points is used. Default values are True for cdiffsurface, and False for the other two.

- __halfwidth__: The arctan disregistry halfwidth (in length units) to use for creating the initial disregistry guess.

- __normalizedisreg__: Boolean indicating how the disregistry profile is handled.  If True (default), the disregistry is scaled such that the minimum x value has a disregistry of 0 and the maximum x value has a disregistry equal to the dislocation's Burgers vector.  Note that the disregistry for these endpoints is fixed, so if you use False the initial disregistry should be close to the final solution.

- __fullstress__: Boolean indicating which of two stress formulas to use.  True uses the original full formulation, while False uses a newer, simpler representation.  Default value is True.
