        Remarks:
            In theory, if every 'Stats' object kept their entire sample then we could estimate all the
            values that we calculate below empirically by mixing all samples into a single big pot and
            then recalculating mean, variance and SEM. Unfortunately, this approach while simple has two
            drawbacks. First, if a benchmark has many simulations with many interactions this means that 
            our package will always be constrained since our memory would be O(n) to interactions. Second, our 
            computation complexity would also be O(n) to interactions since merging stats would require relooping 
            over all samples again. One downside of not taking the simple approach is that stats with N == 1 
            become problematic since we don't know their variance. Therefore we adjust for this below by 
            adding the average variance back in for ever stat with N == 1.
