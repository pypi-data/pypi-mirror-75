THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED 
=================================

Future development has been directed to the `idrsolutions client`_, which can be used for the same purpose. This package will receive no more updates. 

BuildVu Python Client
=====================

Convert PDF to HTML5 or SVG with Python, using the BuildVu Python Client to
interact with IDRsolutions' `BuildVu Microservice Example`_.

The BuildVu Microservice Example is an open source project that allows you to
convert PDF to HTML5 or SVG by running `BuildVu`_ as an online service.

IDR Solutions offer a free trial service for running BuildVu with Python, 
more infomation on this can be found `here.`_

--------------

Installation
------------

Using PIP:
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    pip install buildvu

For other methods / ways to install, check out the `Python Docs`_.

--------------

Usage
-----

Basic:
~~~~~~

First, import BuildVu and setup the converter details by creating a new
``BuildVu`` object :

::

    from BuildVuClient import BuildVu
    buildvu = BuildVu('http://localhost:8080/buildvu-microservice')

You can now convert files by calling the methods available. ``convert()`` will 
start the conversion process. For example to convert to html5 : 

::

    # Convert the file with the input method specified
    results = buildvu.convert(input=BuildVu.UPLOAD, file='path/to/file.pdf')

    # Return a URL where you can view the converted output.
    print(results['downloadUrl'])

Alternatively, you can specify a url from which the server will download the 
file to convert.

::

    # Convert the file with the input method specified
    results = buildvu.convert(input=BuildVu.DOWNLOAD, url="http://link.to/filename")

    # Return a URL where you can download the converted output.
    print(results['downloadUrl'])

Once you have converted the file you can also specify a directory to download 
the converted output to:

::

    # Download the converted output to a specified directory:
    buildvu.downloadResult(results, 'path/to/output/dir')

Additional parameters can be used in ``convert()``, they are defined in our 
`API`_

--------------

Changes for docker version
--------------------------

If your BuildVu service requires authentication, you can set the username and password by passing an additional tuple argument as shown below:
::

    from BuildVuClient import BuildVu
    buildvu = BuildVu('http://localhost:8080/buildvu-microservice', auth=("username","password"))

Code of Conduct
===============

Short version: Don't be an awful person.

Longer version: Everyone interacting in the BuildVu Python Client
project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is
expected to follow the `code of conduct`_.
