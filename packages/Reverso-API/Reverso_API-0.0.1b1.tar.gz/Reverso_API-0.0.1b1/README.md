# Reverso-API

### What's this?
*This is a wrapper around Reverso's ([reverso.net](https://reverso.net)) API for Python.*

## What is Reverso?
[Reverso](https://reverso.net) is a pretty powerful and useful tool for those who learn foreign languages.
It consists of such sub-apps:
+ [Context](https://context.reverso.net) -- translation of words and complex phrases with usage examples provided.
+ [Conjugator](https://conjugator.reverso.net) -- a verb conjugator.
+ [Dictionary](https://dictionary.reverso.net) -- a dictionary (both definitions and translations to other languages).
+ [Spell Checker](https://reverso.net/spell-checker) -- a spell checker.
+ [Translation](https://www.reverso.net/text_translation.aspx) -- a translator which supports sentences, apart from words and phrases.
+ and others

It also has a pretty good "Say" feature for various languages ([Reverso Voice](https://voice.reverso.net/RestPronunciation.svc/help);
