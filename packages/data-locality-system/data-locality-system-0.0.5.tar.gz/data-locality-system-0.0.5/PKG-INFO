Description: # data-locality-system
        
        DLS is a library and pattern that tries to keep data and processing near together for latency and performance.
        
        # Usage
        
        Split up your API request handler into a series of methods with each method being responsible for some API call or processing.
        
        Automatically
        
        * OpenTracing wraps all your spans
        * Requests are routed to servers which are favourable
        * Requests run in parallel using threads.
        
        # Usage
        
        Run each DLS service using Gunicorn.
