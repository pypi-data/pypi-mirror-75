Best vs Fast Model:
    - Best will give a more accurate OCR analysis of the pages
    - Fast will allow for a faster OCR analysis

Image Preprocessing:
    - Preprocessing is better for written text or pictures taken in poor lighting
    - Image is run through a filter that performs grayscale and flat-field correction

PSM Number:
    3 = Fully automatic page segmentation, but no OSD. (Default)
    4 = Assume a single column of text of variable sizes.
    5 = Assume a single uniform block of vertically aligned text.
    6 = Assume a single uniform block of text.
    7 = Treat the image as a single text line.
    8 = Treat the image as a single word.
    9 = Treat the image as a single word in a circle.
    10 = Treat the image as a single character.
    11 = Sparse text. Find as much text as possible in no particular order.
    12 = Sparse text with OSD.
    13 = Raw line. Treat the image as a single text line, bypassing hacks that are Tesseract-specific.
