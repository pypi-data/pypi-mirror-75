Description: # screen_brightness_control
        A Python tool for controlling the brightness of your monitor
        
        ### How to install:
        * Clone/download the repository
        * Enter the folder it has been cloned to and run "pip3 install ."
        * That should be all
        
        ### How to use:
            import screen_brightness_control as sbc
            current_brightness = sbc.get_brightnness()
            sbc.set_brightness(current_brightness+5)
        
        The module has 2 basic functions: set_brightness and get_brightness.
        On Windows these use the WMI module, which is nice and simple. On Linux, however, they use a variety of methods.
        They will try to run light and xbacklight commands and if that does not work they will edit the /sys/class/backlight files
