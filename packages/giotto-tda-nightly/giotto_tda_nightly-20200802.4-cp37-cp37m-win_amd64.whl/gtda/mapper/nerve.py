    This transformer is the final step in the
    :class:`gtda.mapper.pipeline.MapperPipeline` objects created
    by :func:`gtda.mapper.make_mapper_pipeline`. It is not intended for
    direct use.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_intersection : int, optional, default: ``1``
        The minimum size of the intersection between Mapper cover sets
        required to create an edge in the Mapper graph.

    Attributes
    ----------
    X_ : list of tuple
        Nodes of the Mapper graph obtained from the input data for
        :meth:`fit`. It is a flattened version of the input Mapper cover,
        with the addition of a globally unique node ID as the first entry in
        each tuple. Created only when :meth:`fit` is called.

    edges_ : list of dict
        Edges of the Mapper graph obtained from the input data for
        :meth:`fit`. Each edge is a dictionary with two keys:
        ``'node_indices'`` is mapped to a pair of triples characterising the
        two adjacent nodes; ``'intersection'`` is mapped to the array of
        indices of points in the intersection between the two nodes. Created
        only when :meth:`fit` is called.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : list of list of tuple
            Input data structure describing an abstract Mapper cover. Each
            sublist corresponds to a (non-empty) pullback cover set --
            equivalently, to a cover set in the filter range which has
            non-empty preimage -- and contains triples of the form ``( \
            pullback_set_label, partial_cluster_label, indices)`` where
            ``partial_cluster_label`` is a cluster label within the pullback
            cover set identified by ``pullback_set_label``, and ``indices``
            is the array of indices of points belonging to cluster ``( \
