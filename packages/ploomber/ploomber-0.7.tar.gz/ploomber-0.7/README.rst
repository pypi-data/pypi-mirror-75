List your pipeline tasks in a ``pipeline.yaml`` file, declare which upstream tasks to use as inputs and where to save outputs. Ploomber will propagate inputs to downstream consumers and orchestrate pipeline end-to-end execution.

You can open your Python scripts as Jupyter notebooks for development. During execution, they are converted to notebooks to embed tables and charts:

SQL pipelines are also supported:

(you can even mix SQL and Python in the same pipeline)

Ploomber also keeps track of source code changes to speed up builds by skipping up-to-date tasks. This is a great way to interactively develop your projects, sync work with your team and quickly recover from crashes (just fix the bug and build again).

Works with Python 3.5 and higher.


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install ploomber


To install Ploomber along with all optional dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install "ploomber[all]"

``graphviz`` is required for plotting pipelines:

.. code-block:: shell

    # if you use conda (recommended)
    conda install graphviz
    # if you use homebrew
    brew install graphviz
    # for more options, see: https://www.graphviz.org/download/


Create a new project
--------------------

.. code-block:: shell

    ploomber new


Python API
----------

There is also a Python API for advanced use cases. This API allows you build
flexible abstractions such as dynamic pipelines, where the exact number of
tasks is determined by its parameters.
