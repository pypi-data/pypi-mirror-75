"""
First version (very basic and naive) of what I think would be the best way to handle files without using a specific file
reader.

The main purpose of this file is to be a fileObject factory, where fileObject is the resulting instance of our multiple
file readers/handlers/wrappers. That way, one can have direct access to the object and its properties.

Examples:
    loader = Loader("myFile.jpg")
    # Here, image is an instance of PILFile. PILFile could be derived from Image, because most files read by PIL are
    # single image files.
    image = loader.load()
    for channel in image.channels:
        channel.display()

    loaderCZI = Loader("myCzi.czi")
    # Here czi is an instance of CZIFile. CZIFile could be composed of ImageCollection instances (z-stack, time series,
    # map, etc.), because it is not always in the same format. Some files can contain z-stack, while others are just
    # one image of 3 channels, or 48 * 3 tiles making an image of 3 channels. Inheritance is not the best way to go
    # with czi files.
    czi = loader.load()
    if czi.isZStack:
        images = czi.zstack
    elif czi.isTimeSeries:
        images = czi.timeSeries
