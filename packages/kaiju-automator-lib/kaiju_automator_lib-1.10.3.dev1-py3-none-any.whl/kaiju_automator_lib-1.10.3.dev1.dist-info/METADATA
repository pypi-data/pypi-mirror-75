# kaiju-automator-lib

This library is used as the python interface between client software and kaiju-mqtt-py, to make requests of the automator module on the RAE.

This library is used for a few purposes:

* Get a test plan for a device
* Run a test plan for a device
* Cancel a test plan currently running on a device

## Request data format

Most requests to the automator module require a device identifier. This is one or more of: an ESN, an IP, or an ADB serial number. Examples:

```json
{"device_ip": "192.168.144.10"}
{"device_esn": "RKU..."}
{"device_serial": "..."}
```

There is a newer format that moves this into a "target" object with shorter syntax:
```json
{"target": {"ip": "192.168.144.10"} }
{"target": {"esn": "RKU..."} }
{"target": {"serial": "..."} }
```

These identifiers are typically merged into larger request objects, such as test plan run or test plan cancel requests.

## Test plan response data format

The test plan data format is described generally in client.py. A more general discussion of what decisions can be made from the contents of this object needs to be written.

## Test plan run request data format

The test plan run request data format is also described generally in client.py. It requires only minor modifications to the response from a test plan request. 

## Test result data format

Test plan results are reported as a map describing the results of a test plan run. These formats should be more generally documented in a language-agnostic location, as they apply to all clients of the automator.
