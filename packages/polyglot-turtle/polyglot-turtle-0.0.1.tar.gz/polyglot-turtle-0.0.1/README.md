To install, run

```
pip install polyglot-turtle
```

Only python 3.6+ is supported. This driver does not expose any USB-to-serial functionality, for that you should use something like [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/).

There are some simple examples in the git repository. More documentation coming soon.
