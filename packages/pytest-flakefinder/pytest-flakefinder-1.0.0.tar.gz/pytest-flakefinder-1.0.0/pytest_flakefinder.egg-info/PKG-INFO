        Runs tests multiple times to expose flakiness.
        
        ----
        
        This `Pytest`_ plugin was generated with `Cookiecutter`_ along with `@hackebrot`_'s `Cookiecutter-pytest-plugin`_ template.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * When enabled it will 'multiply' your tests so that they get run multiple times without having to restart pytest.  This helps you find flakiness in your tests.
        * You can limit your flake runs to a particular timeout value.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install with setup.py::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        For best flake-finding combine with pytest-xdist::
        
            pip install pytest-xdist
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Flake Finding
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Enable plugin for tests::
        
            pytest --flake-finder
        
        This will run every test the default, 50, times.  Every test is run independently and you can even use xdist to send tests to multiple processes.
        
        To configure the number of runs::
        
            pytest --flake-finder --flake-runs=runs
        
        To find flakes in one test or a couple of tests you can use pytest's built in test selectiong.
        
        Finding flakes in one test::
        
            pytest -k test_maybe_flaky --flake-finder
        
        When used with xdist the flake finder can expose many timing related flakes.
        
        Timing Out
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        When using flake-finder as part of a CI run it might be useful to limit the amount of time it will run.
        
        Running with timeout::
        
            pytest --flake-finder --flake-max-minutes=minutes
        
        Tests started after the timeout will be skipped.
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with `tox`_, please ensure
        the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.
