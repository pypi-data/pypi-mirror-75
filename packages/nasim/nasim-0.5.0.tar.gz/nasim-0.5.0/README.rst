Network Attack Simulator
========================

|docs|

Network Attack Simulator (NASim) is a simulated computer network complete with vulnerabilities, scans and exploits designed to be used as a testing environment for AI agents and planning techniques applied to network penetration testing.

**Note**: NASim is currently under active development so there will be small changes still occuring that may affect some functionallity. However, I'm hoping for a stable release soon.
