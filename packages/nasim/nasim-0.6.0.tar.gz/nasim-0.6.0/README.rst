**Status**: Still under development, interface is stable but expect some more features and bug fixes

Network Attack Simulator
========================

|docs|

Network Attack Simulator (NASim) is a simulated computer network complete with vulnerabilities, scans and exploits designed to be used as a testing environment for AI agents and planning techniques applied to network penetration testing.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the latest version of NASim hosted on PyPi is via pip::

  $ pip install nasim


To get the latest bleeding edge version and install in development mode see the `Install docs <https://networkattacksimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/installation.html>`_


Using with OpenAI gym
---------------------

NASim implements the `Open AI Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_ environment interface and so can be used with any algorithm that is developed for that interface.

See `Starting NASim using OpenAI gym <file:///home/jonathon/Documents/rl_pentesting/NetworkAttackSimulator/docs/build/html/tutorials/gym_load.html#gym-load-tute>`_.
