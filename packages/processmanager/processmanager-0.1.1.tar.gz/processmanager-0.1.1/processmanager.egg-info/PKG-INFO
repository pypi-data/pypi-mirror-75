Description: # processmanager
        A multiprocessing process manager for Python programs  
        
        It provides:  
          * Simple offloading of work to other processor cores  
          * State management for the functions in those processes  
            * It is easy to cancel in-progress work, which can be useful if a user clicks 'Cancel' in a GUI
          * Logging of exceptions while running offloaded functions  
          * Streaming of results to main process from generator functions
            * This can help smooth out IPC load curve by avoiding an all-at-once result transfer
          
        Original use case:  
          * GUI program that calls back-end functions for work  
          * GUI has a cancel button that should always work, so:  
            * the GUI mainloop should not be blocked  
            * the called functions should intermittently check if the user has pressed the cancel button  
          * Want to avoid running new work when the user wants to cancel  
          * Want to work with generators and multiprocessing  
            * e.g. send results constantly to main process instead of all at once  
          
        Installation:  
          * pip install processmanager
