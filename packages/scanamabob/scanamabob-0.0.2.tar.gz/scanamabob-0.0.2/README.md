# Scanamabob

Scanamabob is a set of AWS-specific tools that aide in managing the security of AWS environments.

Scanamabob is currently in an alpha development state. As such, many expected features are missing or incomplete and there may be significant changes in the near future that may break any automations made around the current version. 

### Features

- Intelligent scanning of AWS environment for common security misconfigurations
- S3 auditor for identifying publicly exposed resources

## Configuration

Scanamabob uses the boto3 library to consume the AWS API. As such, Scanamabob is configured via the `aws` cli commands.

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [****************ZXIh]: dXJ5eWIgZ3VyZXIh
AWS Secret Access Key [****************dHRm]: didxIHRocmZmIGxiaCBuY2NlcnB2bmdyIHJuZmdyZSBydHRm
Default region name [us-east-1]: 
Default output format [json]: 
```

## Basic operation

Runs like a standard python app, `-h` can help you find the small set of supported options.

```
Usage: scanamabob <command> [-h] [command-specific-arguments]

Scanamabob v0.0.2 - AWS Security Tooling

This tool is in a very early phase of development and is undergoing active development. Many desired features are currently missing and incomplete. Early release of this version through PyPI is intended to generate useful feedback from potential users.
