# DESCRIPTION

mgmr is a python3 script that allows an user to merge merge requests in any
GitLab instance.

It makes uses of an ini-format configuration file to store the url of the
instance and the personal access token used to interact with the GitLab API of
the hosted instance. And it uses information stored in the git repository in
the form of remotes to guess which GitLab instance it should interact with.

# CONFIGURATION

mgmr will aggressively try to create a configuration file in the following path
under certain conditions:

. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mkmr/config (if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
. $HOME/.config/mkmr/config (if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set)

The configuration is an ini-format with the same sections, keys and values as
used by python-gitlab.

Example configuration:

```
[gitlab.alpinelinux.org]
url = https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org
private_token = 123456789abcdefg
```

# CACHE

mgmr will read the files written in cache, as described in mkmr-cache(7), to
stablish a connection between a branch and what merge request has that branch
as its source.

# EXAMPLES

The following show examples of how to use the different options that mgmr
provides, note that almost all options can be mixed and match as you please:

## Merging lots of merge requests

```
mgmr 1 2 3
```

## Use another configuration file

```
mgmr --config=/path/to/temporary/configuration
```

## Permanently switching to a new token

```
mgmr --token=NewTokenSoNice --overwrite
```

## Merge via branch name (branch in this case is named foo)

```
mgmr foo
```

## Remove stale branch files (branch files that have no local branch)

```
mgmr --clean-cached-branches
```
