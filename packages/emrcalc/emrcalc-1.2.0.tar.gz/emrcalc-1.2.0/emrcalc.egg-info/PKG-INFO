Description: Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) Calculator
        ==========================================
        
        #### Overview
        
        This project implements a Python 3.7+ Tkinter GUI to facilitate the following EMR calculations which I find useful as a student of Astrophysics:
        - Conversion between Energy, Frequency, and Wavelength.
        - Update the units or quantities of any of those 3 characteristics.
        - Displays of Kj/mol and the related EMR band in English.
        - Automatic quantity and EMR band update after editing.
        
        The package itself can be placed in a pip3 repository, Anaconda3 repository, or simply stored in a directory via download from github.
        
        Some special files in addition to the emrcalc/*.py source code:
        - ```HISTORY.txt``` - the update history
        - ```misc/SCREENSHOT.png``` - a sample screenshot
        - ```misc/url.txt``` - URLs to background information
        
        #### Dependencies
        
        ```
        numpy
        scipy
        tkinter - included with Python 3
        tkinter.ttk - included with Python 3
        ```
        
        #### Installation
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip emrcalc
        ```
        
        #### Invocation from a terminal window command-line
        
        ```
        emrcalc
        ```
