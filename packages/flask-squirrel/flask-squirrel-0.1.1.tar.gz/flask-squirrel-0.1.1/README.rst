Flask-Squirrel
==============

|PyPI version| |Python versions| |ci| |Documentation status|

The squirrel collects your nuts and stores them into your SQL database so it is a REST API which accesses your database.
It is based on Flask, Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Major benefits:

- The database data is formatted as a JSON which can be used by the great jQuery library `DataTables <https://datatables.net/>`_.
- Multilanguage
- Allows custom business logic
- Basic document/file upload support
- No HTML is generated - REST API only (JSON)
- Server-side filtering
- The "Orderings" demo provides a web frontend application which is quite generic.

*Note: this project is in testing stage. Any contributions are welcome!*

Also see the `Read the Docs documentation <https://flask-squirrel.readthedocs.io>`_ which is under construction.


First Steps to Run the Demo
---------------------------

There is a small document management example to show how you can use Flask-Squirrel. The goal is to upload a document on a server
and assign it to an ordering of material a small company uses for its projects.

*Note: This demo needs at least Python 3.7 because of the function datetime.datetime.fromisoformat() for the initial DB creation. Flask-Squirrel itself also works with Python 3.6.*

The following steps are made for Linux; for Windows or Mac you should adapt some paths in the configuration file. Do the project setup:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 --version
   # should be at least 3.7 for running the demo

   # go into your project directory
   git clone https://github.com/ClNo/flask-squirrel.git
   cd flask-squirrel
   
   python3 -m venv venv    # if you have multiple versions: call python3.7 ..
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   python setup.py develop

To run the Python backend on port 5000 (automatically loads the configuration from ``orderings-config.json``):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples/orderings
   python3 backend.py


You should get the following output of the backend:
   
.. code-block::

   INFO in flask_app: Overriding config item SECRET_KEY: dev -> _5#y2LF4Q8z-\xec]/
   INFO in flask_app: Overriding config item SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE: None -> Lax

Now you can test the REST API with a tool like curl:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/orderings-api/users?get=data_spec&version=1&lang=en'

The result contains the data but as well editor specification (argument "get=data_spec"):

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "data": [
           {
               "users": {
                   "iduser": 1,
                   "username": "admin",
                   "firstname": "John",
                   "lastname": "Test",

           },
           {
               "users": {
                   "iduser": 2,

               "DT_RowId": 2,
               "users_state": {
                   "name": "active"
               }
           },
           {
               "users": {
                   "iduser": 3,
                   "username": "u2",
                   "firstname": "John",
                   "lastname": "Test",
                   "credential_hash": "----------",
                   "authentication_level": 0,
                   "state": "active"
               },
               "DT_RowId": 3,
               "users_state": {
                   "name": "active"
               }
           },
           {
               "users": {
                   "iduser": 4,
                   "username": "u3",
                   "firstname": "Lance",
                   "lastname": "Armstrong",
                   "credential_hash": "----------",
                   "authentication_level": 0,
                   "state": "inactive"
               },
               "DT_RowId": 4,
               "users_state": {
                   "name": "inactive"
               }
           }
       ],
       "options": {
           "users.state": [
               {
                   "label": "(State)",
                   "value": null
               },
               {
                   "label": "active",
                   "value": "active"
               },
               {
                   "label": "inactive",
                   "value": "inactive"
               }
           ]
       },
       "filters": null,
       "editor-filters": null,
       "translation": {}
   }

You can also access the backend with a JavaScript web application in a browser with the URL ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/orderings/index.html``. Flask acts as file server which provides the html/css/js files and images.

*Note: Flask-Squirrel is made to work with the very good browser component DataTables.*
You can download a trial version of the  `DataTables Editor <https://editor.datatables.net/download/download?type=js>`_ and copy it into examples/orderings/frontend/DatatablesEditor/datatables.min.js and datatables.min.css .
   
If you have the DataTables Editor you are able to create, edit and delete the table rows from the web application:

   :target: Demo Editor

To make any changes in the protected tables you can login as **admin / adm123** which is also specified in configuration file ``orderings-config.json``.
   
*Note: Even the Orderings demo is a bit raw it can be used to publish any kind of SQL tables! The JS scripts get mostly everything from the Flask-Squirrel backend and therefore you can do already much with this demo code!*
