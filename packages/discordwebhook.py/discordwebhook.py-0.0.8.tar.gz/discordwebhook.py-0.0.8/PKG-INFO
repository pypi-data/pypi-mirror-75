        Example

          from discordwebhook import create # Import discordwebhook create
        
          webhook = create.Webhook() # Create Webhook object
          embed = create.Embed() # Create embed object
        
          webhook.username("Example Webhook") # Override webhook username as 'Example Webhook'
          webhook.message("Hello! This is a message from an example webhook with the `discordwebhook.py` library!") # Message to go with the embed
        
          embed.title("Github Logo") # Embed title as 'Github Logo'
          embed.image(url="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/25/25231.png") # Embed image as github logo
          embed.color(0x808080) # Gray embed color

        **0.0.7 and 0.0.8 Changelog**
        
         | Added discordwebhook.discordwebhook
         | `discordwebhook.fetch.Webhook()` now supports a Webhook() object instead of just string
         | Changed `discordwebhook.discordwebhook.version.recent` to `current` with alias `recent`
         | When using webhooks set information is stored in variables and can be accessed later by using (webhook).(setData), for example webhook.message
         | Added message and tts kwarg to .send to allow for one line webhook sends
         | Added kwargs to embed creation to create an experience identical to discord.py
         | Added docstrings at the top of files
         | Started error handling for embeds, checks on send to keep projects working
        
         | Fixed fatal error which occured with all embeds after 0.0.7
