=========================

    Use Dutch conventions for partner names:
    - have infixes
    - have initials
    - split first and last name (provided by partner_firstname)

Roadmap
-------

- allow to turn on/off initials and infix separately
- add nickname (roepnaam) field to also turn on and off separately
