# Flappy Bird Game Engine
The purpose of this project is to provide a simple game engine for running Flappy Bird. The engine is powered by Pygame and can be used simply by importing the GameEngine class into a project and utilizing the provided methods.

**game_engine.WINDOW_SIZE**<br/>
A tuple declaring the width and height of the game window.
