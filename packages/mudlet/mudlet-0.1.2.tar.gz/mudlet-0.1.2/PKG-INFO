Description: 
        Assume you are really annoyed with Lua and want to use a reasonable
        scripting language. Say, Python.
        
        This module lets you do that.
        
        It establishes a bidirectional link between Mudlet/Lua and Python and
        exchanges structured messages between the two.
        
        Mudlet can do HTTP requests in the background, so we send a "long poll" PUSH
        request to the Python server. The reply contains the incoming messages (as
        a JSON array).
        
        There are a couple of optimizations to be had:
        
        * if "httpGET" is available, we use that instead of an empty PUSH.
        
        * if the platform supports Unix FIFO nodes in the file system, we use that
          for sending to Python, as that's faster and less expensive than a HTTP
          request per message.
        
        The only required parameter on the Mudlet side is the port number.
        
        Errors / exceptions are generally propagated to the caller.
