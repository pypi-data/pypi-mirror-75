Description: # GPGraph
        
        **Genotype-phenotype maps in NetworkX**
        
        Port a `GenotypePhenotypeMap` to a [NetworkX Digraph](https://networkx.github.io/).
        
        ## Basic Example
        
        GPGraph follows NetworkX syntax. Initialize a graph, add the
        genotype-phenotype map object, and draw the graph. This library even
        comes with a draw method, `draw_gpgraph`, suited for genotype-phenotype graphs.
        
        ```python
        from gpmap.simulate import MountFujiSimulation
        from gpgraph import GenotypePhenotypeGraph
        from gpgraph.pyplot import draw_gpgraph, draw_edges
        
        # Simulate a genotype-phenotype map
        sim = MountFujiSimulation.from_length(4, roughness_width=1)
        
        # Turn the genotype-phenotype map into a networkx object
        G = GenotypePhenotypeGraph(sim)
        
        # Draw the graph
        figure = draw_gpgraph(G,
                              edge_colors = 'gray', 
                              node_size=400)
        ```

        ## Install
        
        Clone this repo and install with `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## To develop
        
        Clone this repo and run `setup.py` as follows
        
        ```
        python setup.py develop --user
        ```
        
        This way, if only python scripts are being changed nothing has
        to be reinstalled.
