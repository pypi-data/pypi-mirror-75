Description: 
        FiPy is an object oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver,
        written in Python, based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach.  This
        combination provides a tool that is extensible, powerful and freely
        available.  A significant advantage to Python is the existing suite of
        tools for array calculations, sparse matrices and data rendering.
        
        The FiPy framework includes terms for transient diffusion, convection and
        standard sources, enabling the solution of arbitrary combinations of
        coupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs.  Currently implemented
        models include phase field treatments of polycrystalline, dendritic, and
        electrochemical phase transformations, as well as drug eluting stents,
        reactive wetting, photovoltaics and a level set treatment of the
        electrodeposition process.
