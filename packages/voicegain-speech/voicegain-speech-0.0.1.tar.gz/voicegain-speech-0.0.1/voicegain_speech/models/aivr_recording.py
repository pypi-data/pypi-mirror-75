    Voicegain Speech Recognition API v1

    # New  [RTC Callback API](#tag/aivr-callback) for building interactive speech-enabled phone applications  (IVR, Voicebots, etc.).    # Intro to Voicegain API This API is provided by [Voicegain](https://www.voicegain.ai) to its registered customers.  In addition to this API Spec document please also consult our Knowledge Base Articles: * [Web API Section](https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/categories/360001288691-Web-API) of our Knowledge Base   * [Authentication for Web API](https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/sections/360004485831-Authentication-for-Web-API) - how to generate and use JWT   * [Basic Web API Use Cases](https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/sections/360004660632-Basic-Web-API-Use-Cases)   * [Example applications using Voicegain API](https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/sections/360009682932-Example-applications-using-Voicegain-API)  **NOTE:** Most of the request and response examples in this API document are generated from schema example annotation. This may result in the response example not matching the request data example.</br> We will be adding specific examples to certain API methods if we notice that this is needed to clarify the usage.  # Speech-to-Text: Recognition vs Transcription Voicegain web api provides two types of methods for speech recognition.   + **/asr/recognize** - where the purpose is to identify what was said in a context of a more constrained set of choices.   This web api uses grammars as both a language model and a way to attach semantic meaning to spoken utterances. + **/asr/transcribe** - where the purpose is to **transcribe** speech audio word for word, no meaning is attached to transcribed text.   This web api uses large vocabulary language model.      The result of transcription can be returned in three formats. These are requested inside session[].content when making initial transcribe request:  + **Transcript** - Contains the complete text of transcription + **Words** - Intermediate results will contain new words, with timing and confidences, since the previous intermediate result. The final result will contain complete transcription. + **Word-Tree** - Contains a tree of all feasible alternatives. Use this when integrating with NL postprocessing to determine the final utterance and its meaning. + **Captions** - Intermediate results will be suitable to use as captions (this feature is in beta).  # Async Sessions: Real-Time, Semi Real-Time, and Off-Line  There are 3 types of Async ASR session that can be started:  + **REAL-TIME** - Real-time processing of streaming audio. For the recognition API, results are available within less than one second.  For the transcription API, real-time incremental results will be sent back with about 2 seconds delay.  + **OFF-LINE** - offline transcription or recognition. Has higher accuracy than REAL-TIME. Results are delivered once the complete audio has been processed.  Currently, 1 hour long audio is processed in about 10 minutes. + **SEMI-REAL-TIME** - Similar in use to REAL-TIME, but the results are available with a delay of about 30 seconds (or earlier for shorter audio). Same accuracy as OFF-LINE.  It is possible to start up to 2 simultaneous sessions attached to the same audio.   The allowed combinations of the types of two sessions are:  + REAL-TIME + SEMI-REAL-TIME - one possible use case is a combination of live transcription with transcription for online streaming (which may be delayed w.r.t of real time). The benefit of using separate SEMI-REAL-TIME session is that it has higher accuracy. + REAL-TIME + OFF-LINE - one possible use case is combination of live transcription with higher quality off-line transcription for archival purposes.  Other combinations of session types, including more than 2 sessions, are currently not supported.  Please, let us know if you think you have a valid use case for other combinations.   # Audio Input  The speech audio can be submitted in variety of ways:  + **Inline** - Short audio data can be encoded inside a request as a base64 string. + **Retrieved from URL** - Audio can be retrieved from a provided URL. The URL can also point to a live stream. + **Streamed via RTP** - Recommended only for Edge use cases (not for Cloud). + **Streamed via proprietary UDP protocol** - We provide a Java utility to do this. The utility can stream directly from an audio device, or from a file. + **Streamed via Websocket** - Can be used, e.g., to do microphone capture directly from the web browser. + **From Object Store** - Currently it works only with files uploaded to Voicegain object store, but will be expanded to support other Object Stores.   # JWT Authentication Almost all methods from this API require authentication by means of a JWT Token. A valid token can be obtained from the [Voicegain Portal](https://portal.voicegain.ai).   Each Context within the Account has its own JWT token. The accountId and contextId are encoded inside the token,  that is why API method requests do not require these in their request parameters.  More information about generating and using JWT with Voicegain API can be found in our  [Support Pages](https://support.voicegain.ai/hc/en-us/articles/360028023691-JWT-Authentication).   # noqa: E501
