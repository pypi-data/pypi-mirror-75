Installation
============

```
pip install brooks-mfc
```

Usage
=====

This driver uses an undocumented REST API in the devices's web interface for communication.
The compatibility and stability of this interface with all Brooks controllers is not guaranteed.

### Command Line

To test your connection and stream real-time data, use the command-line
interface. You can read the flow rate with:

```
$ brooks-mfc 192.168.1.200
{
    "Customer Flow Totalizer": 0.0,
    "Flow": -0.3,
    "Flow Hours": 1.0,
    "Flow Totalizer": 0.0,
    "Live Setpoint": 0.0,
    "Operational Hours": 50.0,
    "Setpoint": 0.0,
    "Supply Voltage": 22.93,
    "Temperature": 27.11,
    "Valve Position": 0.0
}
```

You can optionally specify a setpoint flow with the set flag:
`brooks-mfc 192.168.1.150 --set 7.5.` The units of the setpoint and return are
specified using the `--units` flag. See `mfc --help` for more.

### Python

This uses Python â‰¥3.5's async/await syntax to asynchronously communicate with
the mass flow controller. For example:

```python
import asyncio
from brooks_mfc import FlowController

async def get():
    async with FlowController('the-mfc-ip-address') as fc:
        print(await fc.get())

asyncio.run(get())
```

The API that matters is `get`, `set`. Optionally, units can be passed with 
either command. If no units are specified the existing units configured for
the device are used.

```python
>>> await fc.get()
>>> await fc.get('%')
{
    "Customer Flow Totalizer": 0.0,
    "Flow": -0.3,
    "Flow Hours": 1.0,
    "Flow Totalizer": 0.0,
    "Live Setpoint": 0.0,
    "Operational Hours": 50.0,
    "Setpoint": 0.0,
    "Supply Voltage": 22.93,
    "Temperature": 27.11,
    "Valve Position": 0.0
}
```
```python
>>> await fc.set(10)
>>> await fc.set(10, 'SCCM')
```

There's much more that could be set or returned from the flow controllers but 
I haven't had a reason to flesh all the the options out. Feel free to submit an 
issue with requests or a PR.
