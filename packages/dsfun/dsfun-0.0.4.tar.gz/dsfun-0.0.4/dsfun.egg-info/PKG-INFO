        # DSfun
        
        **This package is under development and limited for now. Eventually, it will contain a special categorical loss function class for training machine learning algorithms. The goal features include:**
        - Wrapping in a simple interface for many useful loss functions based on confusion matrix
        - Differentiability (compatibility with tensorflow)
        - Scalable to multilabel problems
        - Time efficiency optimizations
        - Working with missing labels
        
        Limitations:
        - Loss function that aren't widely studied, should be used with caution and proper validation
        - If calculating on batches, it might give a biased estimation of global loss
        - As the class is broad, some of the functions might not converge at all
        
        # Instalation
        
        ```
        pip install dsfun
        ```
        
        # Usage example
        
        ```
        import tensorflow as tf
        from dsfun import f1_loss, f1_score
        
        y_true = tf.constant([[1.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
        y_pred = tf.constant([[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5], [1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])
        
        print(f1_loss(y_true, y_pred, 'macro'))
        print(f1_score(y_true, y_pred, 'macro'))
        ```
