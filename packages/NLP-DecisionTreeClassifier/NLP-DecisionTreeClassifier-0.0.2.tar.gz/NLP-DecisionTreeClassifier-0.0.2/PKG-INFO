Description: # NLP-DecisionTreeClassifier
        Sci-kit Learn Decision Tree Classifier for identifying word entities in text 
        
        # Installation Instructions!
        pip install NLP-DecisionTreeClassifier
        
        To train a model using this Decision Tree Classifier, you need to provide a text file,
        that it will be trained on. Example large_text_file.txt
        
        1. Call get_sentences_from_text(file_path)
        The file path is the route to the text file
        2. Call sentence_processor(file_path, sentence)
        This is the same file_path, the sentence parameter is step 1.
        3. Call train_model(model_name, file_path_model)
        The model name will be the model file's name, saved in the file path.
        
        After training you can get accuracy scores for the model, or predict on unseen data
