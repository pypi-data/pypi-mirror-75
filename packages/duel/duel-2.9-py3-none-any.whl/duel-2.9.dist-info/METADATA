## How to Play
### Objective
Maneuver sword and position in order to avoid your opponent's attacks. Match your opponent's guard and deflect incoming strikes. Attack the opponent in low, mid, and high guarding positions.  Move your sword into your opponent's from above or below to disarm, but be quick for they can reclaim their fallen sword by ducking near it. If you strike where your opponent is not prepared, you will slay them. The first duelist to reach the opponent's flag on the opposite side of the field claims victory!
