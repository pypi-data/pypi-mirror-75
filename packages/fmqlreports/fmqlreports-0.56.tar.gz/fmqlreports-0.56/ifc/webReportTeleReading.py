Report TeleReading and the supporting IFCs, documents and images. Very particular IFC.
Cover [1] both Acquisition and Reader sides (including when they are the same VistA) and
[2] the configuration (files) used in all cases.

BETTER INTERP/CONFIG SETUPs (not even clear to me!):
- what's with Boise stuff? 
- remote service name vs local? ie/ one portland 'remote' "BETIC TELERETINAL IMAGING (PORTL" / 2006.5841 has many local 123.5 service types (where one each per local site like Yakama) 
     ie/ local, per instit service name [many] - global (note remote) service name
<--------- ie need to combine the configs tables ie/ local name (instit + local service name) ------> one service based remote name (per remote VistA as a whole)
- ex/ seems like 2006... Queue only uses more global sounding local service DIABETIC TELERETINAL IMAGING IFC (PORTLAND) for eye care and not all the individual per instit services supported in the system
  <------------ ie/ what does the queue use!!!
  BUT the little EYE of YAK TELE-EYE SCREENING (BOI) IFC is used ... ie/ 
- WANT TO SEE 'unused configs'!!!!!
- BIGGIE: split of 1/2/3 (local:local not IFC) ++ what's the no procedure about 
ie/ CONSISTENT configs to go with other stuff

> A (placer) consult created with the Service name (2005.5841->123.5) results in a (filler) consult with the service name Remote Name in the Remote Reading Site ... 2005.5841 also decides how entry is triggered. 

============================= TODO: Content =====================

TODO: [1] fin ac [2] finish Reader Side (align consults) + [3] HL7 vs RPC + [4] neaten/finish final rep form <------ gives new template
- the biggie is FILLER: extrapolate a list as if there is a config file for "filler reading services" ... => 
- need PUG [only internal]
- combine table better ie/ see 2006.5841 ac service -- bring in its Remote Reading Site ie/ show combination.
- RPCs/HL7 attribution and code paths (static report/table) ... see below ie/ BEYOND what data shows unless there is HL7 logs?
  - telereader use lower in SPO (only Eye) but COS consistent with all remote using it!
  - MAY REWORK USER TABLE into 'roles' based on transitions AND not the one summary in queue (who is a reader? responsible? no? ...)
- [FINAL FORM] <-------------- when done beyond freps mv, note IFC in general context + TYPER use rework as neater (not lot's of random types.) MAY DO TYPER explicitly within here ie/ don't run through front end => no need to do custom there ... build in reframe to report.

    Combination of 123.5 (has or hasn't 'Remote Reading Site') and 2006.5841 
    (identifies specifically as telereader acquisition service) identifies telereading
    location and the shape of Consults. 
    
    For all telereader acquistion services (in 2006.5841) ...
    
            Read     123.5 Has 'Remote Reading Site'    123 Role
            ----        -------------------            ----------
            LOCAL               NO                        NONE
            IFC/REMOTE          YES                     P:PLACER
            
    but there's room for error in configuration. In 757, one LOCAL site
    (acquire and read on-site locally) is never used for local reading of
    local acquisitions (ifc_role NONE). All of its consults have ifc_role
    F:FILLER which points to it being a remote reader for another site, one
    that should NOT be in 2006.5841. This can only be known by examining the
    consults of a service and excluding services from acquisition that are
    F:FILLER.
    
    Note that so far, don't see any mixed situations ie/ remote site treats
    a Local Service as its remote Reader AND the site does so itself too ie.
    2006.5841 is valid but the service is doing double duty.
