        ===================================================
        
        At the moment just a small statistics tool that helps the Browser-Team to implement
        the right Keywords.
        
        We want to know which keywords are massively used in our community.
        In the first step we would like to get this information to know which Keywords are missing
        in Browser Library.
        
        Later we also will show you which of your keywords are already replaceable by Browser and
        how to do so.
        
        We appreciate your help!

        Installation
        ------------
        
        If you already have Python >= 3.6 with pip installed, you can simply
        run:
        
        ``pip install robotframework-browser-migration``
        
        If you have Python 2 ... i am very sorry! Please update!

        How it works
        ------------
        
        This small script analyzes your output.xml and creates a statistic over the usage of your
        SeleniumLibrary Keywords.
        
        It will check which Selenium Keywords are used, and how often they are called in general.
        It also check how many different parents (Keywords, TestCases or TestSuites) calls this keyword
        directly. This "parent" count is the number of places you may have to change when migrating later.
        
        We never ever ever take any of your private or confidential data!
        We also just uses hashes of the names of your
        Tests and Keywords to sum up their appearance.
        And also these hashes are never ever stored in any file.
        
        The generated data/statistic are absolutely anonymous!
        
        You will see all collected data as a statistics table when finished.
