# BLLog - A simple and easy-to-use logger

The goal of the project was to create a very simple and easy to use logger
that can log both to console and to a file. It has a one-liner initialization but
also can be configured in various ways if you need to. Console color support is available
on Windows and Linux using `termcolor` and `colorama` but can be disabled. 

Feel free to make an issue or pull request on GitHub or even make a fork to add
more functionality.
