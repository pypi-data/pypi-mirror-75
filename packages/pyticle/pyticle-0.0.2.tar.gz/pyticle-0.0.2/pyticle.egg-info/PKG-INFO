Description: # pyticle
        A Python Library for Particle Swarm Intelligence
        
        [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/owhadi/pyticle.svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/owhadi)
        
        This package implements the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in pure python. The only thing you need to is 
        installing the package and call it with the right parameters!
        
        PSO is an interactive meta-heuristic algorithm that uses "particles" as a candidates for solutions. The goal is to move the particles 
        towards the global/local minimum in each iteration.
        
        ## Installation
        Simply install this package by running the following command:
        ```bash
        pip install pyticle 
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To minimize the 2D function `my_func` in range [-15, 10] using 100 particles via 80 iterations:
        ```python
        from pyticle.swarm_optimization import SwarmOptimization
        optimizer = SwarmOptimization(cost_func=my_func, particle_num=100, omega_start=1, omega_end=0.0,
        Â coef=[2.0, 2.0], low_bound=-15.0, high_bound=10,
        Â boundary_strategy='random', var_size=2, max_iter_num=80, elite_rate=0.1)
        optimizer.optimize()
        ```
        
        ## Demo
        
        In this section, you can see the results of using this package for two simple 2D benchmarks. To run the benchmarks, run:
        ```python
        from pyticle.demo_run import demo_run
        demo_run()
        ```
        
        ### The Sphere Function
        Here is the evolution of 100 particles in 100 iterations to find the minimum of [the Sphere function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sphere_function_in_3D.pdf):
        
        ![](demo/x2_particles.gif)
        
        Here is the changes in the minimum, average, and maximum values of the cost function of all particles over time:

        ### The Ackley Function
        Same as the previous example, this is the evolution of 100 particles in 100 iterations to find the minimum of [the Ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function):
        
        ![](demo/ackley_particles.gif)
        
        Here is the changes in the minimum, average, and maximum values of the cost function of all particles over time:
