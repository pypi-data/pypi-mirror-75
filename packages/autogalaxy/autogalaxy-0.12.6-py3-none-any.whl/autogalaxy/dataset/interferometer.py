        The lens dataset is the collection of data (image, noise-map, primary_beam), a mask, grid, convolver \
        and other utilities that are used for modeling and fitting an image of a strong lens.

        Whilst the image, noise-map, etc. are loaded in 2D, the lens dataset creates reduced 1D arrays of each \
        for lens calculations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        imaging: im.Imaging
            The imaging data all in 2D (the image, noise-map, primary_beam, etc.)
        real_space_mask: msk.Mask
            The 2D mask that is applied to the image.
        sub_size : int
            The size of the sub-grid used for each lens SubGrid. E.g. a value of 2 grid each image-pixel on a 2x2 \
            sub-grid.
        primary_beam_shape_2d : (int, int)
            The shape of the primary_beam used for convolving model image generated using analytic light profiles. A smaller \
            shape will trim the primary_beam relative to the input image primary_beam, giving a faster analysis run-time.
        positions : [[]]
            Lists of image-pixel coordinates (arc-seconds) that mappers close to one another in the source-plane(s), \
            used to speed up the non-linear sampling.
        pixel_scales_interp : float
            If *True*, expensive to compute mass profile deflection angles will be computed on a sparse grid and \
            interpolated to the grid, sub and blurring grids.
        inversion_pixel_limit : int or None
            The maximum number of pixels that can be used by an inversion, with the limit placed primarily to speed \
            up run.
