Description: # Functions and Datasets to support statistics book(s) by Julian Faraway
        
        I am the author of
        
        [Linear Models with R](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/LMR/index.html)
        
        and
        
        [Extending the Linear Model with R](https://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/ELM/index.html)
        
        A new book entitled *Linear Models with Python* will be published soon. This package
        contains data (and documentation) along with a few functions to support this book.
        
        # Data
        
        All the datasets from *Linear Models with R* are included. These are all small datasets
        useful for teaching or other example purposes.
        
        You can load a dataset (for example) with
        
        ```
        import faraway.datasets.composite
        composite = faraway.datasets.composite.load()
        composite
        ```
        
        and you can see the description with
        
        ```
        print(faraway.datasets.composite.DESCR)
        ```
        
        The datasets included are
        
        ```

        This is a subset of those available in my [R package on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/faraway/index.html)
        where you can also see documentation on these datasets.
        
        # Functions
        
        Currently, there is only one useful function which is an alternative to the regression summary function
        used in `statsmodels`. It is much more compact. Suppose `lmod` is an OLSresults object, then (note the spelling is `sumary()`)
        
        ```
        lmod.sumary()
        ```
        
        would produce something like
        
        ```
                   coefs stderr tvalues pvalues
        Intercept  7.068 19.154    0.37  0.7154
        Area      -0.024  0.022   -1.07  0.2963
        Elevation  0.319  0.054    5.95  0.0000
        Nearest    0.009  1.054    0.01  0.9932
        Scruz     -0.241  0.215   -1.12  0.2752
        Adjacent  -0.075  0.018   -4.23  0.0003
        
        n=30 p=6 Residual SD=60.975 R-squared=0.77
        ```
