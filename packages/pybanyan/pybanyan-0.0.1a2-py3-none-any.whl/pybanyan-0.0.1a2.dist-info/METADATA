# API library and command-line interface for Banyan Security

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 must be installed.

## Installation 
### Installing the easy way

```console
$ pip install pybanyan
```

### Installing the hard way

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/banyansecurity/pybanyan.git
$ cd pybanyan
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install setup.py
```

## Usage

This package contains both an API client and a CLI tool.
To use either one, you need to [generate] an API token from the Banyan Command Center.

### Banyan CLI tool

Before you use the CLI, create a file called `~/.banyan.conf` in your home directory and paste in your API token:

```ini
[banyan]
api_url = https://net.banyanops.com
refresh_token = MY_API_TOKEN
```

Run the command `banyan` by itself to see the available categories.

```console
$ banyan
usage: banyan [options] <command> <subcommand> [<subcommand> ...] [parameters]

API library and command-line interface for Banyan Security

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           full application debug mode
  -q, --quiet           suppress all console output
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  --api-url API_URL     URL for the Banyan API server. Can also be configured
                        via the BANYAN_API_URL environment variable.
  --refresh-token REFRESH_TOKEN
                        API token used for the initial authentication to the
                        Banyan API server. Can also be configured via the
                        BANYAN_REFRESH_TOKEN environment variable.
  --output-format {table,json,yaml}, -o {table,json,yaml}
                        desired output format (table, json, yaml)

Commands:
  {event,admin,device,user,netagent,shield,policy,role,service}
    event               report on security and audit events
    admin               manage administrator accounts
    device              manage devices

    service             manage web and TCP services and workloads
```

Each of the commands has multiple subcommands. For example, `banyan service` allows you to list services, create/delete, enable/disable, etc. Run the command without any subcommand to see the options:

```console
$ banyan service
usage: banyan service [-h]
                      {attach-policy,create,delete,detach-policy,disable,enable,get,list,test,update}
                      ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

sub-commands:
  {attach-policy,create,delete,detach-policy,disable,enable,get,list,test,update}
    attach-policy       attach a policy to a service
    create              create a new service from a JSON specification
    delete              delete a service
    detach-policy       detach the active policy from a service
    disable             disable a service
    enable              enable a service
    get                 show the definition of a registered service
    list                list registered services
    test                run sanity checks on a service
    update              update an existing service from a JSON specification
```

To see the full help available for any command, just add the `-h` or `--help` option to the end of the command. For example:

```console
$ banyan service attach-policy --help
usage: banyan service attach-policy [-h] [--permissive] [--enforcing]
                                    service_name_or_id policy_name_or_id

positional arguments:
  service_name_or_id  Name or ID of the service to attach a policy to.
  policy_name_or_id   Name or ID of the policy to attach to the service.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  --permissive        Set the policy to permissive mode (allow all traffic and
                      log any unauthorized access).
  --enforcing         Set the policy to enforcing mode (deny unauthorized
                      access).
```

## Development

This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.

### Environment Setup

The easiest way to work on the code is to create a local `virtualenv`. The included Makefile will do that for you:

```console
$ make virtualenv
$ source env/bin/activate
```

### Running tests

Place unit tests in the `tests/` folder and run them with `make test` or `pytest`:

```console
$ pytest tests/
```


### Releasing to PyPi

Before releasing to PyPi, you must configure your login credentials in `~/.pypirc`:

```ini
[pypi]
username = YOUR_USERNAME
password = YOUR_PASSWORD

[testpypi]
username = YOUR_USERNAME
password = YOUR_OTHER_PASSWORD

```

Then use the `Makefile` to upload to pypi.org or test.pypi.org:

```console
$ make test-upload
$ make dist-upload
```

## Deployments

### Docker

Included is a basic `Dockerfile` for building and distributing `Banyan CLI`,
and can be built with the included `make` helper:

```console
$ make docker
$ docker run -it banyan --help
```

## Support
