Description: # r2 (Record2Replay)
        Record2Replay is simple tool to record your requests on specific target and later replay it to automate your daily tasks
        
        __Note:__ This version is still Work In Progress. Record/Replay function should work with no problems, but it is lack of features. 
        
        ## TLDR;
        ```
        # install
        pip install r2
        
        # record responses from another service
        r2 record http://api.plos.org
        
        # or record on the custom name 'api_plos'
        r2 record http://api.plos.org --package api_plos
        
        ```
        
        Go to your browser and type: 
        
        `localhost:5000/search?q=title:DNA`
        
        in your home directory, all response will be saved at
         
        `~/.r2/packages/default/*`
        
        ```
        # to replay packages 
        r2 replay
        
        # or to replay a custom package 'api_plos'
        r2 replay --package api_plos
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        __Note:__ This is partly implemented with 0.2 version.
        
        - Implement an option to parse arguments ex `http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=title:DNA`. Actual version will pass 
        everything on the right side of the `?` and save a file under `search`.
        
        - Add a support for more than one package
        
        ## Installation
        You can install a `r2` software using a python package manager or build it from source code:
        
        ### from pip
        `r2` is available thru `pip`, to install type `pip install r2`
        
        ### from source
        Go into `src` directory of source, and type `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel && cd dist && pip install r2*.whl` 
        
        
        ## Replay files
        Replay files store base information about the response, from the service. 
        
        Actual support:
        - json response 
        
        Future upgrade:
        - raw response
        - additional status codes
        - additional information from headers
        
        ### Format change v0.1 to v0.2
        Since version v0.2, `r2` presents a new format to store response information from the services. 
        Before v0.2 all response was stored as a raw text in the file. Now, the Response is packed: 
        
        _Example_:
        - Before: 
        ```
        {"test": "test_body"}
        ```
        
        - Now:
        ```
        {
        "data_id": "test\endpoint", 
        "actions": [
            {"arguments": {}, 
             "response": {
                 "test": "test_body"}
             }]
        }
        ```
        
        This approach allow us to store different information for whole range of arguments deliver thru the URL.
