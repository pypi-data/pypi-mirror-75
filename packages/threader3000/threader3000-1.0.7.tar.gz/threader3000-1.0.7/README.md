<h5>Multi-threaded Python Port Scanner for use on Linux or Windows</h5>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Threader3000 is a script written in Python3 that allows multi-threaded 
port scanning. The program is interactive and simply requires you to run 
it to begin. Once started, you will be asked to input an IP address or a 
FQDN as Threader3000 does resolve hostnames. A full port scan should take 
three minutes or less depending on your internet connection.
