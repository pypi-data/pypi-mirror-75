Sam & Max Hit the Road is a graphic adventure video game released by LucasArts during the company's adventure games era. The game was originally released for MS-DOS in 1993 and for Mac OS in 1995. A 2002 re-release included compatibility with Windows. The game is based on the comic characters of Sam and Max, the "Freelance Police", an anthropomorphic dog and "hyperkinetic rabbity thing". The characters, created by Steve Purcell, originally debuted in a 1987 comic book series. Based on the 1989 Sam & Max comic On the Road, the duo take the case of a missing bigfoot from a nearby carnival, traveling to many Americana tourist sites to solve the mystery.

The following is a transcript of the long, 20-minute conversation between Sam and Max which happens at the start of the game:

Max: He's not a real guy, Sam! Can I keep his head for a souvenir? Why do you suppose it's ticking?
Sam: That's no head, Max! It's one damned ugly timebomb! Let's leave this criminal cesspool pronto!
Max: Good idea, Sam. Maybe we can ditch the head somewhere while the credits are running. Mind if I drive?
Sam: Not if you don't mind me clawing at the dash and shrieking like a cheerleader.
Max: Sam, is "pronto" a real word?
