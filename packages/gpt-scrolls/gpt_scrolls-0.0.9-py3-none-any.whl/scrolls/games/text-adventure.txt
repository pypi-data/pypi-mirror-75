"Dear knight: You should have reached this forest, if you followed the road. I hope you haven't strayed.

Now there is a dragon that lives in this forest. It came yesterday. Now it lives under an oak. You will find its gold there.

But please, take good care of the dragon. Don't harm it. You must leave it be. No matter how much you want the gold.

I will be watching you, knight.

With love,

Your Queen."
