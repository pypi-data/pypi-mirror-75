# What is Machball?

Machball models the reactive transport
inside high aspect ratio and nanostructured materials for
self-limited processes such as atomic layer deposition (ALD)
and atomic layer etching (ALE).

# Documentation

Machball's documentation can be found under docs and in
[readthedocs](https://machball.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# Install instructions

Using pip:
```
pip install machball
```

From github:
```
git clone https://github.com/aldsim/machball.git
cd machball/
pip install -e .
```

# Quickstart

You can model ALD inside a high aspect ratio feature with just
a few lines of code:
```
from machball import ALDIdeal
from machball.ballistic import Via
ald = ALDIdeal(1e-2, 100, 473, 10, 10e-20, betarec=0)
st = Via(50, 100) # Aspect ratio, and number of segments
dose_times, coverages = ald.saturation_ballistic(st)
```
