Description: # Permafrost
        
        Permafrost is an extention to Django's Permissions framework.
        
        It adds:
        - A View Mixin that supports additional permissions for different methods types (GET, POST, PUT, etc) for extra granular control.
        - A View Mixin that supports logging any failed permission checks to a log configured in Django.
        - An App that supports Client defineable roles and permissions.  This uses the underlying Django Permission system and controls which permissions are exposed to the users.
        
        Adds Client Definable Permissions to Django.
        
        With the v0.1.x versions, there will be some instability with the releases as practical useage is worked out and the docs are formed.
