A Python3.6+ package to trim and extract flags from FASTA  and FASTQ files.

## Features

* Supports both FASTA and FASTQ files.
* Select your reads based on a pattern (regular expression).
* Trim your reads based on a pattern (regular expression).
* Extract parts (flags) of reads based on a pattern and store them in the read headers.
    - Extract the corresponding portions of the quality string too (only for fastq files).
* All patterns use the `regex` Python package to support [*fuzzy* matching](https://pypi.org/project/regex/#approximate-fuzzy-matching-hg-issue-12-hg-issue-41-hg-issue-109).
    - Using fuzzy matching might affect the barber's speed).
* Export reads that do not match the provided pattern.
* Parallelized processing by splitting the fastx file in chunks.
* Filter reads based on quality score of extracted flags.
    - Supports Sanger QSCORE definition (not old Solexa/Illumina one), and allows to specify different PHRED offsets.
