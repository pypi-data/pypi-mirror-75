# L 090 Subsets II
 
--- 
 
``` 
Given a list of numbers that may has duplicate numbers, return all possible subsets.

Example
If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:

[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
copy
Note
Each element in a subset must be in *non-descending *order. The ordering between 
two subsets is free. The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
