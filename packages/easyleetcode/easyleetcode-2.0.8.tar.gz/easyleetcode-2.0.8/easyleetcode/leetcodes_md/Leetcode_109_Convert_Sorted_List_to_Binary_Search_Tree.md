# L 109 Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree
 
--- 
 
``` 

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order,
convert it to a height balanced BST.

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

将有序链表转为二叉搜索树
