# L 110 Balanced Binary Tree
 
--- 
 
``` 


Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example
Given binary tree A={3,9,20,#,#,15,7}, B={3,#,20,15,7}

A)  3            B)    3
   / \                  \
  9  20                 20
    /  \                / \
   15   7              15  7
copy
The binary tree A is a height-balanced binary tree, but B is not.

平衡树的定义是两子树的深度差最大不超过1
