# SYL 4数学和位运算 8Update Bits

---

```

Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M
(e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)
使用 M 代替 N 中的第i位到第j位
Example
Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6

return N=(10001010100)2

Note
In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal,
you should also return a decimal number.

Challenge
Minimum number of operations?


```
i=2,j=4 >>>

> 1024:0b1000`00000`00
> 
> 21:0b`10101`
> 
> 0b1000`10101`00
