# SYL_6二叉树_3Search_Range_in_Binary_Search_Tree

```
Given two values k1 and k2 (where k1 < k2) and a root pointer to a Binary Search Tree. Find all the keys of tree in range k1 to k2. i.e. print all x such that k1<=x<=k2 and x is a key of given BST. Return all the keys in ascending order.

Example
If k1 = 10 and k2 = 22, then your function should return [12, 20, 22].

    20
   /  \
  8   22
 / \
4   12
