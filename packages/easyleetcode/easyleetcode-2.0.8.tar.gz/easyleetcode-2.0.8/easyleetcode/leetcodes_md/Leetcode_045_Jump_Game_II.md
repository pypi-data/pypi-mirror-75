# L 045 Jump Game II
 
--- 
 
``` 
Given an array of non-negative integers,
you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Example
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
(Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)

 Jump Game 的延伸，那题是问能不能到达最后一个数字，而此题只让求到达最后一个位置的最少跳跃数，貌似是默认一定能到达最后位置的
