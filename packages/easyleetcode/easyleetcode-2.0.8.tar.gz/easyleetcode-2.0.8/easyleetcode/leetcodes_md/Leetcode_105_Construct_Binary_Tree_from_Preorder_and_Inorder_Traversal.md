# L 105 Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal
 
--- 
 
``` 

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Example
Given in-order [1,2,3] and pre-order [2,1,3], return a tree:
  2
 / \
1   3
Note
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.
