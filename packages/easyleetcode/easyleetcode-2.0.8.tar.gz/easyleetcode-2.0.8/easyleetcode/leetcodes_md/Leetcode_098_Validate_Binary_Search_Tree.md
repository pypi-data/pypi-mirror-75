# Leetcode_098_Validate_Binary_Search_Tree

```
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Example
An example:

   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
