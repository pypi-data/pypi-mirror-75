# SYL_1字符串_10Longest Common Substring

---

```
Given two strings, find the longest common substring.
Return the length of it.

Example
Given A="ABCD", B="CBCE", return 2.
Note
The characters in substring should occur continuously in original string.
This is different with subsequence.


求最长公共子串，注意「子串」和「子序列」的区别！简单考虑可以使用两根指针索引分别指向两个字符串的当前遍历位置，
若遇到相等的字符时则同时向后移动一位。

```
