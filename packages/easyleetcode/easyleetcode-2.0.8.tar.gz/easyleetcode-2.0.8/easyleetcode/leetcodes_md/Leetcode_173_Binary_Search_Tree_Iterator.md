# Leetcode_173_Binary_Search_Tree_Iterator

```

Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

- Elements are visited in ascending order (i.e. an in-order traversal)
- next() and hasNext() queries run in O(1) time in average.

Example
For the following binary search tree, in-order traversal by using iterator is [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]

           10
         /    \
        1      11
         \       \
          6       12

Challenge
Extra memory usage O(h), h is the height of the tree.

Super Star: Extra memory usage O(1)
