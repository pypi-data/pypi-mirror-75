```


Problem Statement
Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.

Example
For the following binary tree:

  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
copy
LCA(3, 5) = 4

LCA(5, 6) = 7

LCA(6, 7) = 7
