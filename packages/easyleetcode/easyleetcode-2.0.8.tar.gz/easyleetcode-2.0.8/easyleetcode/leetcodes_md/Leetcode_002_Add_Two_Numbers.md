# Leetcode 002 Add_Two_Numbers

---
```

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit.
The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list.
Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

Example
Given two lists, 3->1->5->null and 5->9->2->null, return 8->0->8->null

```
