# L 111 Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
 
--- 
 
``` 
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path
from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Example
Given a binary tree as follow:

        1

     /     \

   2       3

          /    \

        4      5
The minimum depth is 2
