# Leetcode_088_Merge_Sorted_Array

[https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vk4y167Zf](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vk4y167Zf)

```
Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Example
A = [1, 2, 3, empty, empty], B = [4, 5]

After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Note
You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n)
to hold additional elements from B.
The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
