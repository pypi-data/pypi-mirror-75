# L 102 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
 
--- 
 
``` 

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

Example
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
copy
return its level order traversal as:

[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
copy
Challenge
Challenge 1: Using only 1 queue to implement it.

Challenge 2: Use DFS algorithm to do it.
