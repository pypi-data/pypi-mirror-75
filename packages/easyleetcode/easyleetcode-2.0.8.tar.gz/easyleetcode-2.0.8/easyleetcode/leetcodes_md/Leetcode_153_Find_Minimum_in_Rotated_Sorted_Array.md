# Leetcode_153_Find_Minimum_in_Rotated_Sorted_Array

```
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

Example
Given [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] return 0

Note
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
