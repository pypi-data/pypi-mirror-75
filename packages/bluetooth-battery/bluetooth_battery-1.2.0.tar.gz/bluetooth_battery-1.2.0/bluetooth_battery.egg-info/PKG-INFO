Description: # üîãüéß Bluetooth Headset Battery Level
        
        This is a python script to fetch the battery charge level of some Bluetooth headsets.
        
        You need python 3.6 or newer to run the script.
        
        # ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install bluetooth_battery
        
        bluetooth_battery BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
        ```
        
        You can input addresses for as many devices as you want separated by space.
        
        ### It didn't work?
        
        You can set the port number manually by adding a dot at the end of mac address, like this: `00:00:00:00:00:00.3`
        
        Try port numbers `1 to 30` to find the one that works for your device. (wait a few seconds between each try)
        
        If that didn't work, disconnect your device first, and then try again.
        
        ### Still doesn't work?
        
        Please consider that this script doesn't guarantee to support every bluetooth device.
        
        You can open a new issue for discussion or check the existing ones for more information.
