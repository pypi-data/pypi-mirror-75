About KB4IT
===========

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*KB4IT* is a static website generator based on Asciidoctor sources mainly
for technical documentation purposes.

You can see some demos here: https://github.com/t00m/kb4it-adocs

Motivations
^^^^^^^^^^^
-  The main aim is to provide an easy way to write my technical documentation.
-  Don't care about the formatting and focus on the contents.
-  To allow teams to manage their knowledge database easily.
-  Do not depend on third software products like word processors or complex web applications.

Features
^^^^^^^^

Pros
""""

- Writing documentation: Documents must be in Asciidoctor format which is easy to learn.
- Finding documents: Once a document is converted to html, properties can be browsed. Moreover, property pages have filters and a search entry to filter by title.
- Publishing your repository: all necessary files are inside a directory. Browse it or copy it to your web server.
- Serverless: There is no need for a web server. Of course, you can use one if you please.
- Smart compiling: Only those documents added or modified are compiled.
- Use the default themes or build your own custom theme
- By modifying templates, it might be integrated with Github or Gitlab.

Cons
""""

- Not to much documentation at this moment
- No online editor: At this moment, KB4IT doesn't include any online editor. You must create or edit your documents with your preferred editor.
- No dynamic search: KB4IT was developed to be as simple as possible.
- No dependencies at all excepting Asciidoctor (as text processor and publishing toolchain) and Python (the programming language used).
- API is not stable
- Most of the requirements are tailored to my own necessities which might not be the same as yours.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

From source
"""""""""""

If you have used this app before, it might be necessary to uninstall it before:

``pip3 uninstall kb4it -qy``

Then, install it:

``python3 setup.py install --user``

Pypi package
""""""""""""

``pip3 install kb4it --user -U``

Execution
^^^^^^^^^

The most typical usage would be:

``$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory -log DEBUG``

If templates remain the same, force a new compilation:

``$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory --log DEBUG  -force``

If the directory containing the asciidoctor sources have a theme, it will be used. However, you can specify one:


``$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory -theme mytheme -log DEBUG``


You can also specify any_datetime_attribute to sort your documents:

``$HOME/.local/bin/kb4it -source /path/to/asciidoctor/sources -target /path/to/target/directory -sort Published -log DEBUG``


Download
^^^^^^^^
