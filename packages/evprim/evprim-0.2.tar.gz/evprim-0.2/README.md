# Evprim

This library has the object of identify even, odd and compound numbers as individually or in tuple/lists.

### Pre requirements üìã

To install the library, it is recommended have PYTHON installed in its latest version, but if you have an earlier version install the PIP tool.

A way to check if you have PIP installed is write in the terminal: 

`pip --version`

For more information read the documentation [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

### Installation üîß  

To the installation the library write in your terminal:

`pip install evprim`

In case of actualization the library write:

`pip install -U evprim`

## Archives 

It contains 3 archives:

* <a href = "#composite">composite</a>

* <a href = "#even">even</a>

* <a href = "#prime">prime</a>

To Access an archive, we do write 

```python
import evprim.prime 
```

Other example:

```python
import evprim.composite as compt #Rename
```

We can use the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù so we don‚Äôt have to write the exact library from the beginning, accessing the function directly.

```python
from evprim.even import * #All
```

## Running composite ‚öôÔ∏è


List of functions:

* <a href = "#isacomposite">isacomposite</a>

* <a href = "#complitu">lituComposite</a>

#### isacomposite üî©

Emits a **True** if the entered value is a composite number.

```python
import evprim.composite as compt

print(compt.isacomposite(4))
```
Output:

```python 
True
```

Otherwise will emits a **False**

```python
import evprim.composite as compt

print(compt.isacomposite(2))
```
Output:

```python 
False
```

In case of write a *negative* number, *number 0* or *number 1*, will return it a **False** value.  If you write more than 2 numbers or a number of type float it will show an error.

```python
import evprim.composite as compt

print(compt.isacomposite(2,10))
```
Output:

```python
TypeError: isacomposite() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

This is because the object of the function **isacomposite** is the analyze a single value. If you wish to analyze a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù of numbers use the functions <a href = "#complitu">***lituComposite***</a> <a href = "#compnumber">***compositeNumber***</a>.

<span id = "complitu"></span>

#### lituComposite üî©

From a list or tuple, it does a "route" and "ejects" the numbers that aren't composed

```python
import evprim.composite as compt

print(compt.lituComposite([10,-10,100,3,2,4,1,0,12,4.5]))
```

Output:

```python
[10, 100, 4, 12]
```

In case no number is composed, it only throws a *list/tuple* empty

***lituComposite*** will not accept data other than *list/tuple*, even if it is only a single integer, that is work of the <a href = "#isacomposite">***isacomposite***</a> function

Note: As I said can be entered *tuples*, however it causes problems, when I update the project I will fix it

<span id = "compnumber"></span>

#### compositeNumber üî©

It allows to receive multiple *int* values, if any value is not a composite number then do not will returns it:

```python 
print(compt.compositeNumber(1,0,-1,1.5,10,4))
```

Output:

```python
[10, 4]
```
As you can see show a value of type *list*, homewer, if only there were only exclusive a single composed numbers, then it will show the primitive *int* value.

```python
print(compt.compositeNumber(12,3,17,23))
 ```

Output:

```python
12
 ```
In case of that all the value do not a composed number, then will returns **False**.

```python
import evprim.composite as compt

print(compt.compositeNumber(101,89,23,17))
 ```

Output:

```python
False
 ```
<span id = "even"></span>

## Running even ‚öôÔ∏è

List of functions:

* <a href = "#isaeve">isaeven</a>

* <a href = "#odd">isaodd</a>

<span id = "isaeve"></span>

#### isaevenüî©

Emits a **True** if the entered value is an even number.

```python 
import evprim.even as eve

print(eve.isaeven(10))
```
Output:

```python 
True
```
Otherwise will emits a **False**.

```python
import evprim.even as eve

print(eve.isaeven(3))
```
Output:

```python 
False
```
The number *0* is considered an *even* number, the *negative* numbers will show a **False** and *decimals* will show an *error*.

This function is similar to the <a href = "#isacomposite">isacomposite</a> function in that they only accept one value and do not allow *multiples*, nor *lists* and *tuples*.

<span id = "odd"></span>

#### isaoddüî©

Emits a **True** if the entered value is an even number.

```python
import evprim.even as eve

print(eve.isaodd(3))
```
Output:

```python 
True
```

Otherwise will emits a **False**.

```python
import evprim.even as eve

print(eve.isaodd(3))
```
Output:

```python 
False
```
In a few words, is the counterpart of the <a href = "#isaeve">isaeven</a> function.

<span id = "prime"></span>

## Running prime ‚öôÔ∏è

List of functions:

* <a href = "#isaprime">isaprime</a>

* <a href = "#lituprime">lituPrime</a>

* <a href = "#groupPrime">groupPrime</a>

<span id = "isaprime"></span>

#### isaprimeüî©

Emits a **True** if the entered value is an odd number.

```python
import evprim.prime as pri

print(pri.isaprime(3))
```
Output:

```python 
True
```

Otherwise will emits a **False**.

```python
import evprim.prime as pri

print(pri.isaprime(1))
```
Output:

```python 
False
```
The numbers *0*, *1* and negative will emit a **False** and decimals numbers will show an error. This function only supports an only value.

Is the counterpart of the <a href = "#isacomposite">isacomposite</a> function.

<span id = "lituprime"></span>

### lituPrime üî©

From a list or *tuple*, it "loops" and "ejects" numbers that are not composite.

```python
import evprim.prime as pri

print(pri.lituPrime([0,1,3,11,-1,3.5]))
```

Output:

```python
[3, 11]
```

In case no number is composed, it will just throw an empty *list/tuple*. 

***lituComposite*** will not accept data other than *list/tuple*, even if it's just a lone integer number. 

This function Is the counterpart of <a href = "#complitu">lituComposite</a>

<span id = "groupPrime"></span>

### groupPrime üî©

It allows to receive multiple *int* values, if some value is not a prime number then it will not return them.

```python 
import evprim.prime as pri

print(pri.groupPrime(1,0,-1,3,3.5,11))
```

Output:

```python
[3, 11]
```

As you can see it show a value of type *list*, however, if there were only a prime only number, then will show it the value *int* primitive.

```python
import evprim.prime as pri

print(pri.groupPrime(11))
```
Output:

```python 
11
```
In case all values are not a prime number then it will return **False**.

```python 
import evprim.prime as pri

print(pri.groupPrime(4,1,6))
```

Output:

```python
False
```

This function is the counterpart of the <a href = "#compnumber">compositeNumber</a> function.

Note: the tuples have faults.

## Comments üéÅ

Well this is the end of the documentation, it is a small project I wanted to do as pure hobby, so it is too simple, I hope you like it.

I have less than a year learning to use python, I am very beginner in this, if you can give me advice or recommendation I would appreciate it. :)
