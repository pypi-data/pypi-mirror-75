"""
Dynamic loading of data
=======================
This example illustrates how OMAS can load in memory only the data when it is first requested
This is done here for a NC file, but the approach can be extended to any seekable storage system, including IMAS.

import os
from omas import *

# set OMAS_DEBUG_TOPIC to see when data is loaded dynamically
os.environ['OMAS_DEBUG_TOPIC'] = 'dynamic'

# generate some data and save it as a netcdf file
ods = ODS().sample(ntimes=2)
ods.save('test.nc')

# ODS.open() will keep the file descriptor open so that OMAS
# can load in memory only the data when it is first requested
# NOTE: one can use the `with` statement or open()/close()
ods = ODS()
with ods.open('test.nc'):
    # data gets read from NC file when first requested
    print(ods['equilibrium.time_slice.:.global_quantities.ip'])
    # then it is in memory
    print(ods['equilibrium.time_slice.0.global_quantities.ip'])

# save it as a pickle (which will keep memory of the dynamic nature of the ODS)
ods.save('test.pkl')

# load the data back
ods = ODS()
ods.load('test.pkl')

# the data that was loaded is stored in the pickle
print(ods.flat().keys())

# re-open the file descriptor to continue loading more data
with ods.open():
    print(ods['equilibrium.time'])
