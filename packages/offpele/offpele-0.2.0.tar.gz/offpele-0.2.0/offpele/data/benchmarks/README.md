# Benchmarks
Datasets to be used in benchmarking studies for offpele.

## Content
_Content under construction_
- GPCRs
- PPI (Protein-protein inhibitors)
- Small molecule set
- Small molecule set with experimental hydration free energies

## Analysis features
_Content under construction_
- Rotamer library comparison between offpele and PlopRotTemp
- Experimental hydration free energies comparison _(inside the PELE-platform)_
- Comparison of parameters between offpele and PlopRotTemp (bonds, angles, dihedrals, nonbonding and OBC)
- Structural comparison between PELE's OPLS and OFF implementations
- Energetic profile comparison in gold-standard systems (previously published)
