This package provides middleware and utilities for doing virtual
hosting within a WSGI/Repoze environment.  It is particularly useful
within a ``repoze.zope2`` environment, where it may be used as an
alternative to the classic `VirtualHostMonster
<http://www.zope.org/Members/4am/SiteAccess2/info>`_: method of doing
virtual hosting.
