        ```python
        api_key = "<your-javascript-environment-sdk-key>"
        
        def evaluate_my_feature(user):
                featureflow = Featureflow.init(api_key)
        
                if featureflow.evaluate(:'some-cool-feature', user).isOn():
                    maybe_evaluate_my_feature()
                    print("Feature evaluated")
        ```
