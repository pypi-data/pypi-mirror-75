Bayesian Inference for Dynamic Models


BIP is a Python 3.x library for parameter estimation in dynamic models such as those defined as systems of Ordinary differential Equations. For examples of application check the papers below:

**To install, download the latest version from [PYPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/BIP), unpack and follow instructions on README file.**

Installation
------------
BIP is developed in Linux and has only been shown to work on Linux. The  instructions to for its instalation on Ubuntu Linux are roughly:

```bash
$ sudo apt install gnuplot-x11 libgsl-dev python3-pip
$ sudo pip3 install -U BIP
```
Once installed follow the [documentation](http://bayesian-inference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paramest.html#single-session-retrospective-estimation) on how to use BIP.
