.. _SDE:
Stochastic Differential Equations
=================================

The SDE package in BIP, was born out of the need to simulate stochastic model to test the Parameters estimation routines in the Bayes Package. However, it is useful in many general-purpose application since it provides a pure Python implementation of an SDE solver.

Currently it provides a single solving algorithm, the Gillespie SSA. but other algorithms are planned for future releases
