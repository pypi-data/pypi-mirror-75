#-------- OPTICAL DESIGN  -----------------------------#
# Modelisation of the telescope and instrument. There are 2 options:

# If detailed == 1: number of mirrors, lenses, dichroics must be defined as 
# well as the the filer transmission curves and camera quantum efficiency
# If detailed == 0: will load a global throughput curve

# Folder containing the filters transmission of the telescope. 
# Has to be in pyETC/transmissions/filters

"filter_folder": default

# Set up the type and number of optical elements in the telescope and each
# intrument channel.
# Note that the keywords used for defining the instrument channels are free
# to chose (here: VIS1, VIS2). However they must be the same as for the camera 
# properties below.
# 'telescope' contains all optical elements common for all channels
# For each type of element (i.e 'mirrors', 'lenses'...) must correspond a folder
# in pyETC/transmissions/
# These folders contain files in which the transmission are given. 
# For instance here we have one lense N-BaK4 and the file must be
# pyETC/transmissions/lenses/N-BaK4.txt
# You can add your own files and folders.
