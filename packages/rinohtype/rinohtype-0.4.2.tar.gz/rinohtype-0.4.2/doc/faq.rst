PDFs produced by rinohtype contain mostly empty pages. What's up?
    Old versions of some PDF viewers do not support the way rinohtype embeds
    fonts in a PDF (see `issue 2`_). PDF viewers that are known to be affected
    are:

    - pre-37.0 Firefox's built-in PDF viewer (pdf.js)
    - pre-0.41 poppler_-based applications such as Evince

Installing rinohtype using pip fails with *rinohtype requires Python 3.5 or higher*
    rinohtype only works on Python 3.5 or higher. Make sure the `pip` you are
    using is one from a Python 3.5+ installation using ``pip --version``. On
    some operating systems, you may need to use ``pip3``.
