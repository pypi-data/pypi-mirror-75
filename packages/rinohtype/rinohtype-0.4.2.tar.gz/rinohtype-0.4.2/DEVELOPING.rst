Developing
==========

This project makes use of tox_ to manage running tests and other tasks. The
tests can be divided into three categories: checks, unit tests and regression
tests. ``tox.ini`` defines "environments" that configure these tasks. Each of
these are described below. The unit and integration tests make use of the
pytest_ framework.

Tox facilitates running tests on multiple Python interpreter versions. This
requires these versions to be available on your machine. We recommend you use
pyenv_ (or pyenv-win_) to manage the installation of different Python
interpreters.

Environments
------------

``py35``, ``py36``, ``py37``, ``py38``, ``py39``, ``py310``, ``pypy3``
    Runs the unit tests in the interpreter corresponding to the name of the
    environment.

``check``
    Performs various checks using distutils_ and check-manifest_ to see whether

    - the package's meta-data is not missing any parts,
    - the package's long description is valid reStructuredText, and
    - we didn't forget to include any files in the source distribution

``regression``
    Runs "unit-like" regression tests that finish in a short amount of time.
    These tests render small documents whose PDF output is compared to a
    reference PDF.

``longrunning``
    Runs regressions tests that render larger documents. These tests take
    several minutes to complete.

``check-docs``
    Perform checks on the documentation source files using doc8_ and
    sphinx-doctest_.

``build-docs``
    Build the rinohtype documentation using Sphinx, both in HTML and PDF
    formats.

``macapp``
    Build a stand-alone macOS application bundle using briefcase_. This task
    can only be run on macOS.

``wininst``
    Build a stand-alone rinohtype installer for the Windows platform with the
    help of pynsist_. This task also can be run on other platforms than
    Windows.

Customization settings for check-manifest_, doc8_ and pytest_ are stored in
``setup.cfg``.

Managing multiple Python interpreter versions
---------------------------------------------

To be able to test rinohtype against multiple Python interpreter versions,
these need to be available on your machine. pyenv_ can help you easily manage
these. For example, to install CPython 3.8.1, you can run::

    pyenv install 3.8.1

and pyenv will download, build and install this version of CPython for you.

Note that pyenv will install the different Python versions in an isolated
location (typically under ``~/.penv``), so they will not interfere with your
system-default Python versions.

The file ``.python-version`` in the root of the repository specifies which
Python versions pyenv should make available whenever we are inside the
repository checkout. The file lists specific versions of CPython 3.5 to 3.10
and a recent PyPy3 version (Ideally, we should closely track the latest
releases). The ``pyenv_install.py`` script will install the interpreters listed
in ``.python-version`` for you.

With these Python versions installed, you can set up a virtual environment
with tox and some other development tools. The repository comes with a Poetry_
``pyproject.toml`` file to help set up this virtualenv [#]_. The
``pyenv_install.py`` script instructs you how to set up this virtual
environment. Activate the virtualenv like this::

    source .venv/bin/activate

If you install direnv_, the virtual environment can be automatically activated
when you enter the rinohtype reposutory checkout (see the ``.envrc`` file).

.. [#] Note that we only use Poetry for the tox virtualenv for now. It would be
       good if Poetry could replace ``setup.py`` and tools like bump2version
       and twine, but that will require quite some work.

.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/
.. _direnv: https://direnv.net/


Executing tox environments
--------------------------

With all this in place, you can now run tox to execute the environments.
Invoking tox without any options will run all tox environments listed in
``tox.ini``'s ``envlist``. You can specify specific environments by passing
them to the ``-e`` argument::

    tox -e py35,py38        # no spaces!

For each environment, tox will create virtual environments (under ``.tox``) and
install rinohtype (from sdist) in these. Additionally, it will install other
dependencies specified by ``tox.ini`` before running tests.

Continuous Integration
----------------------

We make use of Travis CI and AppVeyor to automatically execute the tox
environments when new commits are pushed to the repository. Travis CI covers
the Linux and macOS platforms, while AppVeyor covers Windows. See the
configuration files ``.travis.yml`` and ``appveyor.yml`` for details.


Making a release
----------------

This is a list of steps to follow when making a new release of rinohtype:

1. Make sure the git clone is clean (``git status`` returns nothing)

   * you can ``git stash`` uncommited changes

2. Perform checks and run tests locally

   * restview_ ``README.rst`` and ``CHANGES.rst`` to check for issues
   * run ``tox`` to run the quick-running checks/tests
   * run the longer-running tox environments: ``longrunning``, ``check-docs``,
     ``build-docs``, ``wininst`` and (if you're on macOS) ``macapp``

3. Set release version

   * ``export VERSION_NUMBER=$(bumpversion --list release
     | grep new_version | sed s/"^.*="//)``
   * change release date in ``rinoh/version.py`` and ``CHANGES.rst``

4. Commit these changes and run all tests

   * ``git commit -am "Bump version to $VERSION_NUMBER"``
   * ``git push``
   * wait for Travis CI and AppVeyor results and verify that all checks passed

5. Remove build and dist directories: ``rm -rf build dist``

6. Build distribution files: ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``

7. Prepare the ``doc/_build/html`` submodule

   * make sure the ``doc/_build/html`` submodule is checked out

        git submodule status doc/_build/html

   * clear the output directory so no obsolete files are left behind::

        rm -rf doc/_build/html/* && rm -rf doc/_build/html/.buildinfo

   * commit the empty directory so that the working dir is clean::

        git -C doc/_build/html commit -am "clean HTML output directory"
        git commit -am "clean HTML output directory"

8. Build and commit the documentation

   * ``tox --installpkg dist/*.whl -e build-docs``
   * ``git -C doc/_build/html add --all``
   * ``git -C doc/_build/html commit --amend -am "v$VERSION_NUMBER docs"``
   * ``git -C doc/_build/html checkout -B gh-pages``
   * ``git commit --amend -am "Update the docs submodule"``
   * check the generated documentation (HTML and PDF)

9. Upload the distribution files to TestPyPI_ using twine_

   * ``twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*``
   * check whether the new release's description (which is a concatenation of
     ``README.rst`` and ``CHANGES.rst``) is rendered properly at
     https://test.pypi.org/project/rinohtype/
   * check whether you can install this version and that it can render a
     reStructuredText file::

        python -m venv /tmp/rinohtest
        source /tmp/rinohtest/bin/activate
        pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rinohtype
        rinoh DEVELOPING.rst

10. Tag the release in and push commits

    * ``git -C doc/_build/html push``
    * ``git tag v$VERSION_NUMBER``
    * ``git push && git push --tags``

11. Upload the distribution files to PyPI_ using twine_

    * ``twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*``

12. Create a new [release on GitHub](https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype/releases/new)

    * Tag version: the release's tag *vx.y.z*
    * Release title: *Release x.y.z (date)*
    * Add a link to the release on PyPI::

          Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rinohtype/x.y.z/)

    * Copy the release notes from the change log

13. Set the new development version

    * ``export VERSION_NUMBER=$(bumpversion --list patch
      | grep new_version | sed s/"^.*="//)``
    * set the date in ``version.py`` to 'unreleased'
    * ``git commit -am "Bump version to $VERSION_NUMBER"``
