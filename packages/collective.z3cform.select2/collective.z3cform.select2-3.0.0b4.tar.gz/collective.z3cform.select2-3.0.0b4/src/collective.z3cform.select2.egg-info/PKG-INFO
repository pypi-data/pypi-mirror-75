        ==========================
        collective.z3cform.select2
        ==========================
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - select2 multivalued facetednavigation widget for 2-level vocabulary created
          with collective.taxonomy.
          Select "Select2" criteria in facetednavigation and select a taxonomy.
        - select2 multivalued z3c.form widget that works nice with 2-level vocabulary
          created with collective.taxonomy
        
        If you want to use the select2 widget instead the default z3cform widget for List/Set of Choice,
        just include file widget/adapters.zcml in another package policy like this :
        
            <include package="collective.z3cform.select2.widget" file="adapters.zcml" />
        
        Theming
        -------
        
        The widget was developped initially for a bootstrap 3 theme and fontawesome.
        There is a search button icon left to the select that upon click open the select.
        If your site doesn't have a bootstrap based theme, you may want to add this
        css rule to your project to hide the tiny button::
        
            button[data-select2-open] { display: none; }
        
        The z3cform widget in display mode uses the badge class, without a comma
        separator so it may be confusing when you don't have style for the badge class.
        You can revert to a comma separated display by including minimal.zcml instead
        of configure.zcml, see Installation below.
        
        
        Translations
        ------------
        
        - One constant Faceted.taxonomyAllString currently in French.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install collective.z3cform.select2 by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                collective.z3cform.select2
            zcml =
                collective.z3cform.select2
                # or collective.z3cform.select2-minimal
        
        
        and then running ``bin/buildout``
        
        You need to install the collective.z3cform.select2 addon to register the
        select2 js library. In a facetednav, add a Select2 criterion.
        
        eea.facetednavigation
        ---------------------
        
        Version 2.0.0+ is only working with eea.facetednavigation 10+.
        If you need to make it work with eea.facetednavigation < 10, use versions < 2.0.0

          [bsuttor]
        
        - Make widget compatible with the latest versions of eea.faceted.vocabularies
          This makes it no more compatible with eea.faceted.vocabularies < 6.7
          [mpeeters]
        
        
        3.0.0b1 (2019-04-16)

        2.0.1 (2018-08-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Do not replace z3cform default widget for List/Set of Choice by
          select2 widget by default.  The widget/adapters.zcml will need to be included
          manually so this behavior is applied.

          [gbastien]
        
        
        1.4.1 (2017-12-01)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed `MultiSelect2Widget` to use a `@property` for `items` as it is the case
          for `SingleSelect2Widget.items` it is inheriting from (that was fixed in
          release 1.4.0).
          [gbastien]
        
        
        1.4.0 (2017-11-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix an issue with the width of hidden elements (e.g. in tabs)
          [mpeeters]
        
        - Restore initialization for multi select2 widgets
          [mpeeters]
        
        - Require `z3c.form >= 3.2.11` where the `SelectWidget.items` is a `@property`
          and no more a callable method.
          [gbastien]
        
        
        1.3.4 (2017-01-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix widget in overlays when loading a form in an existing overlay.
          This worked before 1.3, but another overlay fix in 1.3 broke this case.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.3.3 (2017-01-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Don't use default param feature in select2-widget.js, the previous fix
          was incomplete.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.3.2 (2017-01-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Don't use default param feature in select2-widget.js, this is ES6, IE 10
          doesn't support it.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.3.1 (2016-12-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Rename wrong class facted-select-criterion to faceted-select-criterion
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.3 (2016-12-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Remove specific css rules that was introduced in 1.2
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fix widget in overlays. If you upgrade from 1.1, you need to reinstall
          the profile to add a css in portal_css.
          [cedricmessiant]
        
        - Wrap call to select2 initialization in JS function `initializeSelect2Widgets`
          so it is easy to call from everywhere (like in an overlay initialization).
          Parameter width can be specified when calling `initializeSelect2Widgets`
          and defaults to `resolve`.
          [gbastien]
        
        
        1.2 (2016-08-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Avoid an error if Faceted namespace is not defined
          [mpeeters]
        
        - Add a select2 single and multi select widget
          [mpeeters]
        
        
        1.1 (2016-07-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Use faceted-select2-widget instead of faceted-select-widget to not break
          the original faceted-select-widget widget.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Depends on eea.jquery >= 8.8 to fix images in select2.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Replace collective.taxonomy.widget.TaxonomySelectFieldWidget by the widget
          from this package.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Initialize widgets in overlays now.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        1.0 (2016-04-20)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
