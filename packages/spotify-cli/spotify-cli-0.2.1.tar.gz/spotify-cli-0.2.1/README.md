spotify p
```

Some commands support the `--raw` flag to output the Spotify API JSON response (shell script-friendly).
```bash
$ spotify status --raw | jq --jsonargs .context
{
  "external_urls": {
    "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/album/3mH6qwIy9crq0I9YQbOuDf"
  },
  "href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/albums/3mH6qwIy9crq0I9YQbOuDf",
  "type": "album",
  "uri": "spotify:album:3mH6qwIy9crq0I9YQbOuDf"
}
```

## Notes
- Playback and device-related commands require at least one active Spotify session on any device.
  - You can just start and stop playback to "activate" your device.
  - Your device will remain "active" even when paused.
- Some operations may not be supported on certain devices (i.e. volume control for mobile) and for users not subscribed to Spotify Premium.
- In development: search, browse, more playback options, custom auth scopes.
