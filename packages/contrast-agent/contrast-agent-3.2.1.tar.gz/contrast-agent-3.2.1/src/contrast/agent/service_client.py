            Current callers that will ask for this exception to be raised are:
            1. when initializing communication to Speedracer, because the middleware needs to know if this initialization
                has failed to set settings initialization to false.
            2. when input analysis messages are send to Speedracer, because the middleware needs to know if
                this analysis has failed to re-route the request to call_without_agent.

            Current callers that will not want the exception to be raised:
            1. when final messages are sent to Speedracer for reporting. The middleware is not equipped
                to handle an exception at that time, so if sending these messages fails, the reporting will fail
