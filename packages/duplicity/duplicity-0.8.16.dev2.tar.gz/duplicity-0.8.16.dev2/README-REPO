Getting duplicity to run:
-------------------------

By the numbers:
1) Do the checkout to a location called $DUP_ROOT:
   [for the stable branch]
   bzr branch lp:duplicity $DUP_ROOT
   or
   [for another branch, replace X with series number]
   bzr branch lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/0.X-series $DUP_ROOT
2) cd $DUP_ROOT/duplicity
3) Run "setup.py build_ext" to create _librsync.so
4) cd ..
5) Run "PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/duplicity -V". You will see
   "duplicity $version" instead of the normal version number.
   Versioning comes during the release.

Use PYTHONPATH to set the path each time that you use the binaries:

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/duplicity

or

PYTHONPATH=$DUP_ROOT bin/rdiffdir
