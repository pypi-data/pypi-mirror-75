        # git-scripts
        
        This project is a collection of scripts that increase the functionality of git commands.
        
        ## Installation
        To install git-scripts, in your terminal, type:
        `pip install git-scripts`
        
        ## Scripts
        * `rust-ver`: a script that reads a Rust project's Cargo.toml file to find its (semantic-versioned) version number,
        increments the number, and adds any unstaged/untracked files in the working directory and commits them all
          * usage: `rust_ver.py [-h] [-d DIRPATH] [-l {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARN,INFO,DEBUG,NOTSET} 
            {major,minor,patch,subpatch,alpha,unalpha}]`
          * positional argument:
            * indicates the portion of the version number to be incremented; the choices are:
              * `major`
              * `minor`
              * `patch`
              * `subpatch`
              * `alpha` (alias for `subpatch`)
              * `unalpha` (doesn't increment anything but removes the the subpatch \[e.g. `-alpha0`\] suffix)
          * `-h` (`--help`): display the script's usage information
          * `-d` (`--dir`): use this flag and follow it with a directory path to indicate a git repository directory that is
          different from the current working directory
          * `-l` (`--log-level`): use this flag to set the lowest level of logs to actually log to the console; in decending
          order of strictness, these are the choices:
            * `critical`
            * `error`
            * `warn`
            * `info` (default)
            * `debug`
            * `notset`
          * Examples:
            * `rust-ver major -l debug`
              * assuming the project's version was `1.2.3-alpha2`, the script would update that to `2.0.0` and commit that
              change and anything else in the index
            *  `rust-ver unalpha -d ../some-project`
              * assuming that the project's version was `2.0.1-alpha1` and the current working directory is anything except
              `some-project`, the script would look into `some-project`, update the version to `2.0.1` and commit that change
              and anything else in the index
