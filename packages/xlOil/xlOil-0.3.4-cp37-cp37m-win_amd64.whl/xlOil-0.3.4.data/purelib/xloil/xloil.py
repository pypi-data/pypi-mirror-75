    int, bool, float, str, ExcelArray, Range (optional)

    The type converter should return a python object, which could be an 
    ExcelArray or Range.

    A type converter class may take parameters into its constructor
    and hold state.  It should implement __call__ to behave as a type
    converter function.

    Both functions and classes are turned into a class which inherits from 
    ``typ``.  This is to support type hints only.

    If ``range`` is True, the xlOil may pass an ExcelRange or and ExcelArray
    object depending on how the function was invoked.  The type converter should 
    handle both cases consistently.

    Decorator which tells xlOil to register the function in Excel. 
    If arguments are annotated using 'typing' annotations, xlOil will attempt to 
    convert values received from Excel to the specfied type, raising an exception 
    if this is not possible. The currently available types are

    * **int**
    * **float**
    * **str**: Note this disables cache lookup
    * **bool**
    * **numpy arrays**: see Array
    * **CellError**: Excel has various error types such as #NUM!, #N/A!, etc.
    * **None**: if the argument points to an empty cell
    * **cached objects**
    * **datetime.date**
    * **datetime.datetime**
    * **dict / kwargs**: this converter expects a two column array of key/value pairs

    If no annotations are specified, xlOil will pass a type from the first eight above types
    based on the value provided from Excel.

    If a parameter default is given in the function signature, that parameter becomes optional in 
    the declared Excel function.

    Parameters
    ----------

    name: str
        Overrides the funtion name registered with Excel otherwise the function's 
        declared name is used.
    help: str
        Overrides the help shown in the function wizard otherwise the function's 
        doc-string is used.
    args: dict
        A dictionary with key names matching function arguments and values specifying
        information for that argument. The information can be a string, which is 
        interpreted as the help to display in the function wizard or in can be an 
        xloil.Arg object which can contain defaults, help and type information. 
    group: str
        Specifes a category of functions in Excel's function wizard under which
        this function should be placed.
    local: bool
        Functions in a workbook-linked module, e.g. Book1.py, default to 
        workbook-level scope (i.e. not usable outside that workbook) itself. You 
        can override this behaviour with this parameter. It has no effect outside 
        workbook-linked modules.
    macro: bool
        If True, registers the function as Macro Type. This grants the function
        extra priveledges, such as the ability to see un-calced cells and 
        call the full range of Excel.Application functions. Functions which will
        be invoked as Excel macros, i.e. not functions appearing in a cell, should
        be declared with this attribute.
    is_async: bool
        Registers the function as asynchronous. It's better to add the use asyncio's
        'async def' syntax if it is available. Note that only async RTD functions are
        calculated in the background in Excel
    thread_safe: bool
        Declares the function as safe for multi-threaded calculation. The
        function must not make any non-synchronised access to objects outside
        its scope. Since python (at least CPython) is single-threaded there is
        no performance benefit from enabling this.
    volatile: bool
        Tells Excel to recalculate this function on every calc cycle: the same
        behaviour as the NOW() and INDIRECT() built-ins.  Due to the performance 
        hit this brings, it is rare that you will need to use this attribute.

    If you don't specify this annotation, xlOil may still pass an array
    to your function if the user passes a range argument, e.g. A1:B2. In 
    this case you will get a 2-dim Array(object). If you know the data 
    type you want, it is more perfomant to specify it by annotation with 
    ``Array``.

    -------

        Element types are converted to numpy dtypes, which means the only supported types are: 
        int, float, bool, str, datetime, object.
        (Numpy has a richer variety of dtypes than this but Excel does not.)

        causes errors.

    dims : int
        Arrays can be either 1 or 2 dimensional, 2 is the default.  Note the Excel has
        the following behaviour for writing arrays into an array formula range specified
        with Ctrl-Alt-Enter:
        "If you use a horizontal array for the second argument, it is duplicated down to
        fill the entire rectangle. If you use a vertical array, it is duplicated right to 
        fill the entire rectangle. If you use a rectangular array, and it is too small for
        the rectangular range you want to put it in, that range is padded with #N/As."

    trim : bool    
        By default xlOil trims arrays to the last row & column which contain a nonempty
        string or non-#N/A value. This is generally desirable, but can be disabled with 
        this paramter.
