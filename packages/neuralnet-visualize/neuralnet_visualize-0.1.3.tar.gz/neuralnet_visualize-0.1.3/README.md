# Neural Network Visualizer

## What it is?

A module which creates a neural network with the given architecture(only Dense layers)

## Installation

For installation you can follow the instructions [here](./INSTALLATION.md)

## Examples
Some of the examples can be found [here](./examples)

The docstring style which I have followed is [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## How it looks?

## Future Works

* Add Convolutional layers, Maxpooling, Flatten layers, LSTM's
* Directly from the pickle files
* Specific colors for activation functions
* Directly convert from pytorch models
