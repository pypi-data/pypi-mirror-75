        ## Why qobra?
        
        You can't get much more minimal than qobra. qobra extends mpg123 functionalities
        to provide ease of navigation between your songs. As of version 1.1.0, qobra:
        
        - can play songs in normal and shuffle mode
        - provides a search functionality to filter your music
        - supports a vast variety of file formats thanks to mpg123
        
        ## Installation
        
        qobra is available on PyPI. Install it with pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install qobra
        ```
        
        mpg123 will be installed as a dependency as well.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        qobra [-d dirname] [options]
        ```
        
        Where `dirname` is your music directory. You can also set the music directory in
        qobra's config file to avoid having to type it every time, as explained below.
        
        ## Control
        
        | Key   | Function            |
        | ----  | ---------           |
        | j     | go down a song      |
        | k     | go up a song        |
        | l     | play selected song  |
        | p     | pause song          |
        | t     | toggle playing mode |
        | q     | quit qobra          |
        | o     | play next song      |
        | i     | play previous song  |
        | /     | open search bar     |
        | Enter | submit search       |
        | Esc   | cancel search       |
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        qobra will look for a configuration file in ~/.config/qobra/config.py or use the
        default configuration if it can't find one. You can copy the sample config.py
        file in this repository to ~/.config/qobra/config.py if you want to have your
        own configuration.
        
        You can customize qobra's colors in the config.py file, as well as set your
        music directory to avoid having to write it out on the command line:
        
        ```python
        music_dir = '~/music'
        ```
        
        ## TODOS
        
        If you like this project, you can help with one of these:
        
        - [ ] Implement pause functionality.
        
        ## Issues
        
        - Resizing the window while the search bar is summoned may break the program.
