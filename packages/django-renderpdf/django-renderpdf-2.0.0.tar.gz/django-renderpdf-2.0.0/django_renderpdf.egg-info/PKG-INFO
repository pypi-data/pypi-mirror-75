        **django-renderpdf** is a Django app to render django templates as PDF files.
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Rendering PDFs for web developers is generally pretty non-trivial, and there's
        no common approach to doing this. django-renderpdf attempts to allow reusing
        all the known tools and skills when generating a PDF file in a Django app:
        
        * Use Django template files, which are internally rendered as HTML and them PDF
          files.
        * Use staticfiles app to include any CSS or image files.
        * Simply subclass a ``PDFView`` class which has an interface very similar to
          Django's own built-in ``View`` classes.
        
        Background
        ----------
        
        django-renderpdf actually started out as code on multiple of my own projects
        (including some public ones).
        
        After some time, it became clear that I'd been copy-pasting PDF-related bits
        across different projects, and since co-workers expressed interest in this
        design (using the Django templating system to generate PDFs), it finally made
        sense to move this into a separate library.
        
        Because of this, documentation is still a work in progress (the code far
        outdates this API being public), and while unit tests are lacking, this code
        has had ample field testing
        
        Usage example
        -------------
        
        Sorry, no docs yet! Though ``PDFView``'s methods has extensive docstrings you
        should check.
        
        Here's a usage code example for a view that generates some PDF labels for some
        shipments:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            class LabelsView(LoginRequiredMixin, PDFView):
                template_name = 'my_app/labels.html'
        
                def get_context_data(self, *args, **kwargs):
                    context = super().get_context_data(*args, **kwargs)
        
                    context['shipments'] = models.Shipment.objects.filter(
                        batch_id=kwargs['pk'],
                    )
        
                    return context
        
        And in ``urls.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from django.urls import path
        
            path(
                '/shipments/labels/<int:pk>/',
                views.LabelsView.as_view(),
                name='shipment_labels',
            ),
