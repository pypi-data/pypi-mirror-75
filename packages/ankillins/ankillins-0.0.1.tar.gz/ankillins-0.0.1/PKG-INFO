        ```
        Ankillins doesn't add cards to Anki itself. Instead, it generates `ankillins-result.csv` file which you need to import. 
        ### Important details
        * When you import result file click on the "fields separated by" and type `~`
        * It is better to create your own card type with styles located in `card_styles.css` to get card style close to collinsdictionary page style.
        
        ## Installation
        *Will be available sooner*
