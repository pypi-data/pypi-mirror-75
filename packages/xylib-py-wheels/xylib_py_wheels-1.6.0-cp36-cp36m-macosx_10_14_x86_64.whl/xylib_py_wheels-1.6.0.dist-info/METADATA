This package is a collection of built wheels for xylib-py (https://pypi.org/project/xylib-py/), pending approval of a PR that would autoupload these wheels to that package.
Original Description:
xylib is a library for reading obscure file formats with data from
powder diffraction, spectroscopy and other experimental methods.
For the list of supported formats see https://github.com/wojdyr/xylib .
This module includes bindings to xylib and xylib itself.
The first two numbers in the version are the version of included xylib.
