*A Python API for simulating and analyzing evolution in genotype-phenotype space.*

GPvolve can used to:

1. Build a markov state model from a genotype-phenotype-map.
2. Find clusters of genotypes that represent metastable states of the system, using PCCA+.
3. Compute fluxes and pathways between pairs of genotypes and/or clusters of interest, using Transition Path Theory.
4. Visualize the outputs of all of the above.


The core-utilities of this library are built on top of the pyemma and msmtools packages.
For a deeper understanding of these tools, we recommend reading the docs and scientific
references of the respective libraries ([1]_, [2]_, [3]_).

A rationale for treating fitness landscapes as markov systems can be found in [4]_.

Currently, this package works only as an API. There is no command-line
interface. Instead, we encourage you use this package inside `Jupyter notebooks`_ .
