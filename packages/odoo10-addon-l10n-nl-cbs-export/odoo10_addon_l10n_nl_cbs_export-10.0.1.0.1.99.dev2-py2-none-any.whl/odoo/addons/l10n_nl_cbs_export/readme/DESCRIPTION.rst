CBS = Dutch Bureau of Statistics (Centraal Bureau voor de statistiek)

When you export products within the EU you have to report those exports to the Dutch CBS.
This module will provide a export CSV file which you can upload on the CBS website. The CSV
file is automatically created every month trough a cron job.
