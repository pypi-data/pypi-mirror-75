        A small module for running Git operations...
        
        **Check out [Palc](https://github.com/thetechrobo/python-text-calculator), it's even better than pyGit**
        
        **NOTE: pyGit has not finished development yet. Use with caution!**

        **NOTE 2: pyGit is STILL BEING MAINTAINED. It's just not my priority, as I've been pretty busy lately.**
        
        Documentation and details are in the [wiki](https://github.com/thetechrobo/pygit/wiki).
        
        # Installing from PyPI
        pyGit is on PyPI with the name `pyyGit` (due to another project with the name pyGit). However, you still need to use `import pygit` or `from pygit import *` instead of `import pyygit` or `from pyygit import *`. Because the *package name* is pygit but the PyPI name is pyyGit.
