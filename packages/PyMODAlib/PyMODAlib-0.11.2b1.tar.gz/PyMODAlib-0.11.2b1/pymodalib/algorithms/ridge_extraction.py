    """
    Extracts the curve (i.e. the sequence of the amplitude ridge points) and its
    full support (the widest region of unimodal TFR amplitude around them) from the given
    time-frequency representation of the signal. The TFR can be either the wavelet transform
    or the windowed Fourier transform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tfr : ndarray
        [NFxL array] Time-frequency representation (wavelet transform or windowed Fourier transform), to extract from.
    frequencies : ndarray
        [NFx1 array] The frequencies corresponding to the rows of `tfr`.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of the signal.
    method : {"direct", "ridge", "both"}
        (Default = "direct") The reconstruction method to use for estimating the component's
        parameters (`iamp`, `iphi`, `ifreq`) (see [1]); if set to "both", all parameters are returned as [2xL arrays]
        with direct and ridge estimates corresponding to the 1st and 2nd rows respectively.
    param : [float, float], float, optional
        Parameters for each method, as described in [3].
    normalize : bool
        (Default = False) Noise power in time-frequency domain can depend on frequency, so
        that at lowest or highest frequencies the noise-induced amplitude
        peaks might overgrow the peaks associated with a genuine components,
        thus being selected instead of the latter. To avoid this, the curve
        can be extracted using the normalized amplitude peaks, that are
        non-uniformly reduced in dependence on their frequencies, with a
        suitable normalization being determined based on the dependence of
        the mean TFR amplitude on frequency; setting `normalize` to True
        applies such a normalization.
    wopt : Dict
        Dictionary returned by the wavelet transform function when the `return_opt=True` parameter is passed.
        This should be used when possible.
    path_optimize : bool
        (Default = True) Optimize the ridge curve over all possible trajectories (True) or
        use the one-step approach (False), see [3]; the path optimization
        GREATLY improves the performance of all methods and is not
        computationally expensive (is performed in O(N) operations using
        fast algorithm of [3]), so DO NOT CHANGE THIS PROPERTY unless you
        want to just play and see the advantages of the path optimization
        over the one-step approach; note, that this property applies only
        to methods 1 and 2, as the others are simple one-step approaches.
    max_iterations : int
        (Default = 20) Maximum number of iterations allowed for methods 2 and 3 to converge.
    return_matlab_types : bool
        (Default = False) Whether to return the results as MATLAB types, instead of converting.
        This can reduce overhead when calling another MATLAB-packaged function with the result,
        because the data doesn't need to be converted from MATLAB to Numpy and then back to MATLAB.
    kwargs

    Returns
    -------
    tfsupp : ndarray
        [3xL array] The extracted time-frequency support of the component, containing frequencies of the
        TFR amplitude peals (ridge points) in the first row, support lower bounds (referred to as `omega_-(t)/2/pi`
        in [1]) in the second row, and the upper bounds (referred to as `omega_+(t)/2/pi` in [1]) in the third row.

    """
    Calculates the component's amplitude, phase and frequency as reconstructed from its
    extracted time-frequency support in the signal's transform (WT/WFT).

    Parameters
    ----------
    tfsupp : ndarray, matlab.double
        [3xL array] The extracted time-frequency support of the component, containing frequencies of the
        TFR amplitude peals (ridge points) in the first row, support lower bounds (referred to as `omega_-(t)/2/pi`
        in [1]) in the second row, and the upper bounds (referred to as `omega_+(t)/2/pi` in [1]) in the third row.

        Alternatively, `tfsupp` can be supplied as a [1xL array] of the desired frequency profile; in this case, the
        algorithm will automatically select the time-frequency support around it and the corresponding peaks.
    tfr : ndarray, matlab.double
        [NFxL array] The transform (wavelet transform or windowed Fourier transform), to which `tfsupp` corresponds.
        (Rows correspond to frequencies, columns to time.)
    frequencies : ndarray, matlab.double
        [NFx1 array] The frequencies corresponding to the rows of `transform`.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of the signal.
    wopt : Dict
        Dictionary returned by the wavelet transform function when the `return_opt=True` parameter is passed.
        This should be used when possible.
    method : {"direct", "ridge", "both"}
        (Default = "direct") The reconstruction method to use for estimating the component's
        parameters (`iamp`, `iphi`, `ifreq`) (see [1]); if set to "both", all parameters are returned as [2xL arrays]
        with direct and ridge estimates corresponding to the 1st and 2nd rows respectively.

    .. note::
        In the case of direct reconstruction, if the window/wavelet does not allow direct estimation of frequency,
        then the frequency is reconstructed by the hybrid method (see [1]).

    Returns
    -------
    iamp: ndarray
        Component's amplitude, as reconstructed from `tfsupp` in the signal's time-frequency representation.
    iphi : ndarray
        Component's phase, as reconstructed... (see above)
    ifreq : ndarray
        Component's frequency, as reconstructed... (see above)
