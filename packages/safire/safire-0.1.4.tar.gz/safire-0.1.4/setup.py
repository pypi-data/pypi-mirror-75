    'description': 'A flexible tool to create and delete Google / GSuite service accounts to be used with shared drives.',
    'long_description': '### __SAFIRE__\n#### A flexible tool to create and delete GSuite projects, service accounts and jsons which can be used with shared/team drives.\n\nYou can find safire at either pypi ( https://pypi.org/project/safire/ ) or github ( https://github.com/88lex/safire )\n\n\n__BONUS__:  `safire list all` will create both csv and xlsx files listing name/unique id/etc. for all projects, service accounts, shared drives, groups and group members for your account. Handy for use with other apps and scripts.\n\n- Simple usage syntax: e.g. `safire list projects`\n- Available main commands:\n    - list\n    - add / create\n    - remove / delete\n    - auth\n    - enable\n    - rename\n\n- Most commands will tell you which subcommands are available by simply typing the main command with no flags. e.g. `safire list` or optionally `safire list -h` . Subcommands include:\n    - projects\n    - sas - aka service accounts\n    - keys / jsons\n    - groups\n    - members\n    - drives (yes, safire can create and delete shared drives)\n\n- User configuration information such as project name/prefix, number of projects to create, service account prefix and so on are in the `config.py` file in the /safire/safire folder.\n - All options can be set in either the config.py or via command line flags (-h or --help for any commands)\n - If you install with pip then you can find the location of config.py with `pip list -v | grep safire`, then edit as needed\n\n- Credential files and files created by safire are by default in the user home (~ in linux) directory under safire/creds, safire/data and safire/svcaccts. This location can be changed in config.py\n\n- NOTE: Commands below are in the format `safire command subcommand` This assumes you pip install the script. You can run it directly without installing by navigating to /safire/safire and using `./safire.py command subcommand`\n\n__Recommended to run safire__: \n- Python 3.7 or higher\n- You can run safire without install from the directory holding `safire.py` (e.g. `cd /opt/safire/safire`; `./safire.py list projects`) \n  - To do this you must first run `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n- If you prefer to install and run safire from anywhere on your machine\n  - Navigate to to the base /safire dir where you git cloned safire (not /safire/safire) \n  - Use a recent version of pip that runs with pyproject.toml rather than setup.py \n  - If you want to upgrade pip use `pip install --upgrade pip` or `sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip`\n  - From your /safire folder run `pip install .`  If successful then you should now be able to \n\n__Setup of safire__\n\nBefore running safire you will need one gsuite project (new or old is fine) with several apis enabled.\n- If no project exists go to https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate to create one in your main gsuite account\n- Then go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library. Ensure you choose your main project (dropdown at the top of the page), then enable the following APIs:\n\n    [ __You only need to do this once.__ ]\n\n    - Admin SDK\n    - Google Drive API\n    - Identity and Access Management (IAM) API\n    - Cloud Resource Manager API\n    - Service Usage API\n    - Service Management API\n\nOnce you have enabled the above APIs then go to this page \n- https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials\n- Click Create Credentials\n- Choose `OAuth client ID`\n- For Application type choose `Desktop app` and name it as you like ( \'safire\' or anything)\n- Click Create\n- Finally choose `Download JSON`\n- You will use this JSON to create a token which allows you access to your account and gives you permission to create projects, service accounts, etc. \n  - Keep one copy of this JSON in a safe place, then put a copy named `creds.json` in the `~/safire/creds` folder [specified in your config.py file - you can change the location if you like]\n\nOnce you have this initial project created, all the APIs above enabled and have created/downloaded the credentials creds.json you are ready to use safire.\n\nThe command line is very flexible. You can quickly and easily \n- create projects via `safire add projects 5` will add 5 projects\n- create and delete service accounts(SAs) via `safire add sas proj000` will add \n- create and delete json keys (that let you access shared drives and copy/sync/move files)\n- add the SA emails to groups and shared drives to use with tools like sasync, cloudplow/cloudbox, crop etc.  \n\n`Don\'t be afraid to play with the commands. You can fix almost anything by deleting and recreating components in a few minutes.  [The exception being projects, which you should not delete as they go into a 30-day holding bin before being fully deleted, and count against your project quota.]`\n\nA typical, simple flow to use safire: \n\n- download a credentials json \n- create auth token to enable safire to access your account: `safire auth all` will create two tokens, one to access projects/drives/etc and one to access groups \n- add projects: `safire add projects 5` will add 5 projects using the prefix in your config.py file\n- enable apis: happens automatically when you add projects, but can be done manually\n- create sas: `safire add sas ""` will add sas to all or your projects using # of SAs in config.py \n- download json keys: `safire add jsons ""` will create and download service account json keys to the folder in config.py\n- add members to group: `safire add members "" mygroup@domain.com` will add all SA emails from all projects to a group called mygroup@domain.com\n- add group to shared (team) drive\n\n\n## Detailed commands\n\n__list__\n\n    safire list\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n    safire list COMMAND\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n    List drives, projects, service accounts (SAs), SA json keys, groups and group members.
