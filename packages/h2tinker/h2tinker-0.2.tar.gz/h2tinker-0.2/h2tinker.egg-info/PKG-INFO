Description: # H2Tinker
        
        H2Tinker is a minimalistic low-level HTTP/2 client implementation in Python.
        
        It is based on [scapy](https://github.com/secdev/scapy) and also enables directly sending scapy-crafted frames. On top of scapy, h2tinker provides
        * HTTP/2 connection setup and management,
        * TCP and TLS connection setup and management,
        * a user-friendly documented and typed API for creating different frames and requests,
        * documentation and examples on how different attacks can be implemented.
