### Usage

Given a multi-level directory structure:

```ascii
├── one.py
├── two.py
├── child/
│   ├── three.py
```

We can list all child files:

```python
>>> list(get_child_files(root=".", maxdepth=2))
["/one.py", "/two.py", "/child/three.py"]
```

We can also search for a specific filename:

```python
>>> list(get_child_files(root=".", maxdepth=2, match_name="three.py"))
["/child/three.py"]
```

### Installing

To install the package from pypi:

```bash
pip install walkmate
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and build the package locally.

### Docs

Additional details are available in the [full documentation](https://walkmate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To generate the documentation locally:

```bash
multi-job docs
```

### Tests

Unit tests and behaviour tests are written with the pytest framework.

To run tests:

```bash
multi-job tests
```

Additionally, an html report will be saved to the local directory.

### Buildbot

To run the buildbot server:

```bash
cd ci
docker-compose up -d
```

* Builders are configured in master.cfg.
* Build masters read their configuration from https://github.com/JoelLefkowitz/walkmate/walkmate/ci/master.cfg
* Worker and database passwords are configured as environment variables
