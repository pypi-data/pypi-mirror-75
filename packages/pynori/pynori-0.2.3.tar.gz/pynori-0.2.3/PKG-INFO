Description: 
        * Nori in Apache Lucene is a korean morpological analyzer based on Mecab.
        * Pynori is a python-version of nori (Apache Lucene is written in Java).
        * The analysis results are the same (All test cases are passed). 
        * Pynori maybe a little slower than nori because of python script language and less optimized data structures.
        * Pynori includes mecab-ko-dic-2.1.1-20180720 for system dictionary.
        * Pynori is compatible with Python 3.7 and is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.
        * it will probably work in various python versions.
