* Nori in Apache Lucene is a korean morpological analyzer based on Mecab.
* Pynori is a python-version of nori (Apache Lucene is written in Java).
* The analysis results are the same (All test cases are passed). 
* Pynori maybe a little slower than nori because of python script language and less optimized data structures.
* Pynori includes mecab-ko-dic-2.1.1-20180720 for system dictionary.
* Pynori is compatible with Python 3.7 and is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.
* it will probably work in various python versions.
* See, the left Homepage link, to see how to use this project.
* See, the original nori at: https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/master/lucene/analysis/nori
* See, mecab-ko-dic at: https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko-dic
