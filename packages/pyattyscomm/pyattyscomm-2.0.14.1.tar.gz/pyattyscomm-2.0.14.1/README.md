# AttysCOMM

The C++ & Python API for the Attys bluetooth data acquisition board: http://www.attys.tech

The library is cross platform: It's for Linux, Windows and Mac.

## Installation instructions

### Linux

```
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```

This will generate: a dynamic library libattyscomm*.so and a static
one called libattyscomm_static.a.


### Windows:
Under windows only the static library is generated which
should be used for your code development.
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" .
```
and then start Visual C++ and compile it.


### MacOS

For pure commandline install:
```
cmake .
make
make install
```
This will generate: a dynamic library libattyscomm.*dylib and a static
one called libattyscomm_static.a.

If you want to debug/develop the library in Xcode:
```
cmake -G Xcode
```


## Usage

A small test program is in the `examples` directory which scans
for an Attys and then prints the incoming data to stdout.
Type `cmake .`, `make` and then `./attystest` to run it.

Here is a step by guide how to code it:

1. scan for Attys
```
int ret = attysScan.scan();
```

2. Check the number of Attys detected
```
attysScan.getNAttysDevices()
```

3. If devices have been detected you can get them via
`getAttysComm(0,1,2,etc)`.

4. Set the parameters, for example:
```
attysScan.getAttysComm(0)->setAdc_samplingrate_index(AttysComm::ADC_RATE_250HZ);
```

5. Register a callback (optional)
```
attysCallback = new AttysCallback(this);
attysScan.getAttysComm(0)->registerCallback(attysCallback);
```
You need to overload the virtual function of the callback in your program.

6. Start data acquisition
```
attysScan.getAttysComm(0)->start();
```
If you have registered a callback then it's all set!

If you have no callback registered then you need to retreive the
samples from the ringbuffer in steps 7.-9.:

7. Check if ringbuffer contains data and wait till true
```
attysScan.getAttysComm(n)->hasSampleAvilabale();
```

8. Get samples from buffer
```
float* values = attysScan.getAttysComm(n)->getSampleFromBuffer();
```

9. go back to 7)

10. Ending the program:
```
attysScan.getAttysComm(n)->quit();
```


## Python (SWIG)

This libary is fast and multi threaded. It performs
the data acquisition in the background while python can then
do the postprocessing.

Packages for Linux, Windows and MacOS are on PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/pyattyscomm/

### Linux

#### Python package (pip):

Make sure you have the bluetooth development libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
```
and then install with:

```
pip3 install pyattyscomm
```

#### From source

You need to have swig-3.x installed. Then run:

```
cmake .
make
make install
./setup.py install
```

and then you can load the module `pyattyscomm` system-wide!


### Windows

#### Python package (pip):

In the python console type:

```
pip install pyattyscomm
```

### From source

Install `swig` and re-run the C++ installation.
Make sure to select "Release" in Visual Studio as python
is usually not installed with its debug libraries.
After compilation you get:

- `Release\_pyattyscomm.exp`
- `Release\_pyattyscomm.pyd`
- `pyattyscomm.py`

Install them with:
```
python setup.py install
```


### MacOS

#### Python package (pip):

```
pip3 install pyattyscomm
```

#### From source

You need to have swig-3.x installed for homebrew. Then run:

```
cmake .
make
make install
./setup.py install
```

and then you can load the module `pyattyscomm` system-wide!




### How to use

The python API is identical to the C++ one.
All the definitions are in AttysComm.h and AttysScan.h.

Here is an example:

```
# load the module
import pyattyscomm

# Gets the AttysScan class which scans for Attys via bluetooth
s = pyattyscomm.AttysScan()

# Scan for Attys
s.scan()

# get the 1st Attys
c = s.getAttysComm(0)

# if an attys has been found c points to it. Otherwise it's None.

# Start data acquisition in the background
c.start()

# Now we just read data at our convenience in a loop or timer or thread

while (not c.hasSampleAvilabale()):
        # do something else or nothing
	a = a + 1
    # getting a sample
    sample = c.getSampleFromBuffer()

    # do something with the sample
    print(sample)
```

### Example programs

Examples programs are in the `examples` folder and in this 
![github repo](https://github.com/glasgowneuro/attys-python-examples).
