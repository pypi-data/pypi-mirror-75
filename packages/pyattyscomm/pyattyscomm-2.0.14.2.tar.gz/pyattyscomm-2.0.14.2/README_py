========================
Python API for the Attys
========================

Attys is a lightweight wearable bluetooth data acquisition box which can measure anything from temperature to ECG.

It's cross platform and runs under Linux, Windows and macOS.

It has two 24 bit analogue channels, an accelerometer and a magnetometer.

Required packages under Linux
=============================

For Ubuntu Linux install libbluetooth-dev::

      sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev

For other Linux flavours install them from souce:

Quick start guide
=================

Here are the basic steps how to use the API::

      # load the module
      import pyattyscomm

      # Gets the AttysScan class which scans for Attys via bluetooth
      s = pyattyscomm.AttysScan()

      # Scan for Attys
      s.scan()

      # get the 1st Attys
      c = s.getAttysComm(0)

      # if an attys has been found c points to it. Otherwise it's None.

      # Start data acquisition in the background
      c.start()

      # Now we just read data at our convenience in a loop or timer or thread
      # if data is available you can read it from the ringBuffer

      while (not c.hasSampleAvilabale()):
      	    # do something else or nothing

      # getting a sample (array of all Attys channels)
      sample = c.getSampleFromBuffer()

      # do something with the sample
      print(sample)

      # rinse and repeat!


API documentation
==================

Query it via the python help system::

    import pyattyscomm
    help(pyattyscomm)


The Python classes have been generated with SWIG. The header files AttysComm.h, AttysCommBase,h and AttysScan.h provide detailed info about the classes:

On github are python examples which show you how
to plot realtime data from the Attys:
