Description: # Gammahill Distribution  
        This is a Gaussian distribution package that simplifies the creation and performing arithemtic operation on Gaussian distributions.
        
        ## Requirements
        - Python 3
        We highly recommend and only officially support the latest patch release of Python 3.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install gammahill-distribution 
        ```
        
        ## How it works
        ```python
        from Gaussiandistribution import Gaussian
        
        # Initializing a Gaussian instance
        gaussian_one = Gaussian(22, 2)
        print(gaussian_one.mean)
        ```
