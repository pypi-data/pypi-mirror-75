# TorchJPEG

This package contains a C++ extension for pytorch that interfaces with libjpeg to allow for manipulation of low-level JPEG data.
By using libjpeg, quantization results are guaranteed to be consistent with other applications, like image viewers or MATLAB,
which use libjpeg to compress and decompress images. This is useful because JPEG images can be effected by round-off
errors or slight differences in the decompression procedure. Besides this, this library can be used to read and write
DCT coefficients, functionality which is not available from other python interfaces.

Besides this, the library includes many utilities related to JPEG compression, many of which are written using native pytorch code meaning
they can be differentiated or GPU accelerated. The library currently includes packages related to the DCT, quantization, metrics, and dataset
transformations.

## LIBJPEG

Currently builds against: `libjpeg-9d`. libjpeg is statically linked during the build process. See http://www.ijg.org/files/ for libjpeg source.

## Documentation

See https://queuecumber.gitlab.io/torchjpeg/ 

## Install

Install using pip, note that only Linux builds are supported at the moment. 

```
pip install torchjpeg
```

If there is demand for builds on other platforms it may happen in the future. Also note that the wheel is intended to be compatible with manylinux2014
which means it should work on modern Linux systems, however, because of they way pytorch works, we can't actually build it using all of the manylinux2014
tools. So compliance is not guaranteed and YMMV.
