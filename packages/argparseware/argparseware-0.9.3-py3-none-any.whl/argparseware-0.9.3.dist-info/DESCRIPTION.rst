argparse middleware library.

argparseware is designed as a turnkey library for developers who like the
standard library, most specifically argparse. It extends the built-in argparse
library by simply allowing one to define middleware components in a very
simple syntax, improving reusability, while not compromising or reinventing
the programming interfaces they already know.
