Description: CancellationToken for Python
        ---
        
        This library provide simple cancellation token. 
        
        # Usage
        
        First create token
        ```python
        from cancel_token import CancellationToken
        
        token = CancellationToken()
        ```
        
        At any point in time you can check if token has been cancelled:
        ```python
        if token.cancelled:
            print('Operation already cancelled')
            return None  
        ```
        
        To cancel token call its `cancel` method:
        ```python
        token.cancel()
        assert token.cancelled
        ```
        
        It is also possible to add callbacks that will be called on when token is cancelled:
        ```python
        def handler():
            print('Operation has been cancelled')
        
        token.on_cancel(handler)
        ```
        
        **Note**:
        * If token is already cancelled, callback will be invoked immediately.
        * All registered callbacks will be called sequentially during `cancel` call.
        * Callback throwing exception will prevent remaining callbacks from calling. However token will be cancelled
        * During callback invocation token is already cancelled
        * It is possible to add callback from within callback
        * Removing callback from within callback **will not** prevent its execution
