# Rank-To-Group (RTG) score evaluates contribution of confounders

<img src="example/confounder_contribution.png" width="400" />

Batch, cell line, donor, plate, reprogramming, protocol â€” these and other confounding factors influence cell cultures *in vitro*.

RTG score tracks contribution of different factors to variability by estimating how **R**ank maps **T**o **G**roup. 
Scoring relies on ranking by similarity, so there are no explicit or implicit assumptions of linearity.

RTG perfectly works with both well-interpretable data (gene expressions, cell types) 
and embeddings provided by deep learning.

## Usage 

`rtg_score` is python package. Installation:
```bash
pip install rtg_score
```

RTG score requires two DataFrames: one with confounds and ane with embeddings (or other features, e.g. gene expressions)
```python
from rtg_score import compute_RTG_score
# following code corresponds to computing element of the figure above
# 
score = compute_RTG_score(
    metadata=confounders_metadata,
    include_confounders=['batch', 'donor'],
    exclude_confounders=['organoid_id'],
    embeddings=qpcr_delta_ct, 
)
```

An example of code to compute and plot table above is available in [`example`](https://github.com/System1Bio/rtg_score/blob/master/example/Example_qPCR.ipynb) subfolder.
