As such, it can be accessed through\nthe [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) for which, fortunately,\nthere exists a fantastic Python wrapper library called [`mwclient`](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient).\n\n- **IMSLP API.** For convenience, the IMSLP built some *ad-hoc* scripts that can be used to get a\nlist of people and a list of works, in a variety of different formats, including JSON.\n\n### Some quirks of IMSLP\n\nWhile fortunately, as mentioned, IMSLP uses a widely used open-source Wiki platform, MediaWiki, it has a\nhandful of quirks. Such as:\n\n- Composers are stored as `Category`, for instance `Category:Scarlatti, Domenico`. For each composer,\nthere is usually three tabs: "Compositions", "Collaborations" and "Collections"; these are stored as\nseparate categories resulting from the concatenation of the composer and subtype, such as\n`Category:Scarlatti, Domenico/Collections`.\n\n- PDF files for sheet music are stored as "images"; unfortunately, for the time being, the scheme does\nnot appear in the URLs computed for the files. These need to be manually patched.\n\n- The `imslpdisclaimeraccepted` cookie must be set to `"yes"` for files to download properly (otherwise,\ndownloading any file will result in the disclaimer page). With `mwclient`, this can be specified on login.\n    ```python\n    cookies = {\n        "imslp_wikiLanguageSelectorLanguage": "en",\n        "imslpdisclaimeraccepted": "yes",\n    }\n    ```\n\n- Much of the metadata associated with images, such as the internal ID or the download counter, is stored\nseparately than the MediaWiki metadata. This makes scraping the rendered HTML page a necessary endeavour.\n\nFortunately all these quirks are handled by this package!\n\n## Related Projects\n\nHere are a handful of other related projects available on GitHub to access the IMSLP data programmatically:\n\n- [jjjake/imslp-scrape](https://github.com/): Last commit in May 2012 (32 commits), mix of Python and shell, scraping\nthe website for data (people, score links) with HTML parsing.\n\n- [FrankTheCodeMonkey/IMSLP-Scraper](https://github.com/FrankTheCodeMonkey/IMSLP-Scraper): Last commit in June 2020 \n(6 commits), Python, scraping the website for data and scores, with HTML parsing and Selenium.\n\n- [josefleventon/imslp-api](https://github.com/josefleventon/imslp-api): Last commit in May 2020 (17 commits),\nJavaScript, uses [IMSLP\'s custom API](https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:API) to get the list of people and list of works\nprogrammatically through a web API query. \n\nMore recently, and in other languages:\n\n- [IMSLP Instrument Information Parsing Program](https://github.com/yoonlight/imslp): Last commit in July 2020\n(47 commits), uses scraping to extract instrumentation information. \n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nLet\'s be clear that all the heavy lifting is done by [`mwclient`](https://github.com/mwclient/mwclient)â€”and\nthe volunteers who uploaded and/or scanned and/or typeset the scores on IMSLP. \n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the LGPLv3 license, with the understanding\nthat importing a Python modular is similar in spirit to dynamically linking\nagainst a library.\n\n- You can use the library `imslp` in any project, for any purpose, as long\n  as you provide some acknowledgement to this original project for use of\n  the library.\n\n- If you make improvements to `imslp`, you are required to make those\n  changes publicly available.\n  ',
