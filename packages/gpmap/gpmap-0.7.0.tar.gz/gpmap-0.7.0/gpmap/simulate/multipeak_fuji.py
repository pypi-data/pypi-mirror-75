    """Constructs a genotype-phenotype map from a Mount Fuji model. [1]_

    A Mount Fuji sets a "global" fitness peak (max) on a single genotype in
    the space. The fitness goes down as a function of hamming distance away
    from this genotype, called a "fitness field". The strength (or scale) of
    this field is linear and depends on the parameters `field_strength`.
    Roughness can be added to the Mount Fuji model using a random
    `roughness` parameter. This adds a random value (positive or negative)
    to each of the fitnesses. The multi-peak Mount Fuji model defines
    multiple fitness peaks across the map. Each of the peaks defines a
    fitness for every node as described above, but in the end, all but the
    highest fitness value will be discarded, i.e. the fitness of each node
    is defined by the nearest peak.


    .. math::

        f(g) = \\nu (g) + c \cdot d(g_0, g)

    where $\\nu$ is the roughness parameter, $c$ is the field strength,
    and $d$ is the hamming distance between genotype $g$ and the
    reference genotype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wildtype : str
        reference genotype to put the

    mutations : dict
        mutations alphabet for each site

    field_strength : float
        field strength

    roughness_width : float
        Width of roughness distribution

    roughness_dist : str, 'normal'
        Distribution used to create noise around phenotypes.

    peak_n : int.
        The desired number of peaks in map. (Is only guaranteed if roughness_width is 0, else ruggedness might lead to
        additional local fitness peaks.)

    min_dist : int, None (default = 2).
        Minimal distance between any two peaks.

    max_dist : int, None (default = None).
        Maximal distance between any two peaks. If None, maximal distance is going to be the largest possible distance,
        i.e. 5 in a 5-site map.

    a_state : int, None (default = None).
        State that is guaranteed to become a peak. If None, a_state is going to be the wildtype genotype.
        This is done to have to well separated peaks that span the whole map. If unwanted, set any node as a_state
        and/or b_state.

    b_state : int, None (default = None).
        State that is guaranteed to become a peak. If None, b_state is going to be the farthest genotype from wildtype.
        This is done to have to well separated peaks that span the whole map. If unwanted, set any node as a_state
        and/or b_state.

    peaks : list, None (default = None).
        A list of nodes that will be defined as peaks. If None, peaks will be defined randomly using the other arguments
        as criteria.
