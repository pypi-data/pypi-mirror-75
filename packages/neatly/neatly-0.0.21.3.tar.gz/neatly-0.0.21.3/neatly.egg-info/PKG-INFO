Description: # neatly
        
        **NOTE: *neatly* is not yet functional**  
          
        *neatly* is a package designed to facilitate the implementation of [NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) in Python.
        
        ## Installation
        *neatly* can be installed with pip via:
        ```bash
        pip install neatly
        ```
        
        ## Usage/Example
        
        ### Configuration
        When using *neatly*, although a config file isn't strictly necessary, it's highly highly recommended that you use one to streamline *neatly*'s implementation process. In the same folder as the python file that is using neatly functions, create a `config.toml` file. To get started, simply copy-paste this in:
        
        ```toml
        i_count = 2     # Number of inputs
        o_count = 1     # Number of outputs
        pop_size = 30   # Population size of a single generation
        ```
        
        This is an extremely basic `config.toml` file, but it gets the job done. Feel free to adjust the default values in order to steer *neatly* in the direction of your desired network/structure. There are many other useful parameters that can (and should) be tweaked, so make sure to check out <link-to-docs>
        
        ### Hello, world!
        
        Here's an example of how to implement a very simple *neatly* network:
        
        ```python
        import neatly
        
        # Initialize a population and sort into a list of extant species
        pop = neatly.initialize_population()
        almanac = neatly.speciate(pop)
        ```
        
        For more details and tutorials, see <link-to-docs>

        To be completely honest, I don't know why anybody would want to contribute to this pile of hot garbage, and I don't really know how contributing works, but if you're interested email [me](mailto:seanrhee2024@u.northwestern.edu?subject=[Github]%20contributing%20to%20neatly).
